<p><strong>In a short video ad for its Web3 platform, Nike&#8217;s logo is shown.The logo for SWOOSH is right next to the logos for Epic Games&#8217; games Unreal Engine and Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>Nike, a company that makes shoes and clothes, has hinted that it may soon drop a set of non-transferable sneaker tokens in Epic Games&#8217;s famous online game Fortnite.</p>



<p>According to Active Player, more than 242.9 million people have been playing Fortnite in the last 30 days. This could be a big chance for traditional gamers to start using Web3.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great catch with the <a href="https://twitter.com/dotSWOOSH?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@dotSWOOSH</a> reference. <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@FortniteGame</a> integration would be the biggest thing that&#39;s ever happened with NFTs</p>&mdash; Jalazo.eth (@nft4dummies) <a href="https://twitter.com/nft4dummies/status/1669772911970844682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 16, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Nike announced on June 16 that the &#8220;ultimate sneaker hunt&#8221; would start on June 20.</p>



<p>In a short movie that goes with it, the Fortnite logo and the Nike Air Max logo are front and center against a background of clouds moving in the sky.</p>



<p>The name of the sneaker hunt is then revealed to be &#8220;Airphoria,&#8221; and the movie ends with Nike&#8217;s logo for its web3 platform.SWOOSH next to the Unreal Engine logo from Epic Games.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On 6.20 the ultimate Sneakerhunt begins. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3d9.png" alt="üèô" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f32c.png" alt="üå¨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/QgMyA1uXRT" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/QgMyA1uXRT</a></p>&mdash; Nike (@Nike) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nike/status/1669736937085861888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 16, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>At this point, there aren&#8217;t many details, but people in the NFT community think that Nike may have made a game linked to NFT using Fornite Creative 2.0. This feature lets users build their own virtual island game maps using Fortnite assets.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>‚ÄúI remember that Fortnite recently launched Fortnite Creative 2.0, which has a strong self-built map mode similar to creating games on ROBLOX. I guess Nike may have used this mode to create a game. Two years ago, Nike also created a game on ROBLOX, but it was not combined with NFT[s] at that time,‚Äù noted @clone_news_cn.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even though it&#8217;s not 100% certain that NFTs will be in Airphoria,.Since SWOOSH is involved, it seems likely, and Epic Games is open to NFT games, so it could happen.</p>



<p>Lately, Nike&#8217;s NFT division has been stepping up its attempts to get into traditional gaming.</p>



<p>On June 1,.SWOOSH announced that its NFTs will be added to games made by EA Sports, which is among other things the company behind the hugely popular FIFA soccer game series. But it&#8217;s still not clear which EA Sports games will have Nike NFTs in the end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="360" src="https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/metaverse.jpg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-30680" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/metaverse.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/metaverse.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/metaverse.jpg?resize=267%2C150&amp;ssl=1 267w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the Metaverse?</h2>



<p>Using the Metaverse&#8217;s tokens, users may become co-owners of the peer-to-peer digital environment known as the Metaverse. Using the Metaverse, people may add additional value, relationships, and chances to their actual life. The area is adaptable and may be used for anything where connection and community produce value, including networking, business, communications, the arts, and education, in addition to gamification.</p>



<p>A user experience with little or no barriers to interoperability across games, economy, digital assets, art, and education is made feasible by the Metaverse development company. Users are empowered by its decentralized structure to produce valuable things in this new society and reap the benefits of their labor and freely trade their digital assets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What do companies need to know about the Metaverse, And why is it relevant to businesses?</h2>



<p>The Metaverse presents prospects for companies in terms of technology, the economy, and community building for their clients. Businesses may change how they relate to their clients, due to the Metaverse. Companies will be able to develop more enduring and widespread connections with consumers via the Metaverse based on shared ownership, motivation, and experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are some methods that companies may make money from the Metaverse?</h2>



<p>Some monetization strategies may have a tenuous connection to gaming. For instance, in some Metaverses, community members have established enterprises that enable them to make money by developing in-game gameplay techniques. Enterprises may also generate revenue by distributing authority and ownership to members of their communities or organizations, empowering them to establish their sub-entities and businesses and eventually enhancing the value of the larger enterprise. At this point in the Metaverse&#8217;s development, there is a lot of discovery taking place, and business models are being created, tried out, and refined quickly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Certain industries or firms stand to gain the most from the Metaverse?</h2>



<p>Due in large part to the rich gameplay features the Metaverse offers gaming communities, blockchain games, and their players have so far benefited the most from it. Due to the expanding community of builders and players who have flocked to Metaverses in little under two years, Groups of individuals from all around the globe may improve their economic and social situation due to the Metaverse communities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the main factors influencing the growth of the Metaverse?</h2>



<p>The epidemic made it more important for individuals to interact globally, even outside social media. The purpose of the Metaverse, created to do just that, is to improve digital interactions meaningfully. In the Metaverse, there is a place for everyone, and individuals are naturally drawn to changes that will enhance their life. Previously, the development of the Metaverse was based on many of the same principles that led to the established social media sites like Myspace, Facebook, and Instagram. It has increased our ability to connect, network, and communicate while still utilizing the tools we have used.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What role does Web3 recreate in the Metaverse?</h2>



<p>Web3 refers to the stage of the internet where tokenization has made users co-owners of platforms. Contrast this with Web2, the period of the internet when people shared material but did not share ownership. Because decentralized networks provide co-ownership to all members, which is a need for the shared digital space known as the Metaverse, the Metaverse and Web3 depend on them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What modifications are Web3 and the Metaverse making to the gaming sector?</h2>



<p>Beyond anything, we could have anticipated with Web2 or the current edition of the internet, Web3 has expanded the possibilities for gaming. It has made it possible for games that let players earn tokens as they play‚Äîtickets that have value and function in the real world‚Äîto be developed. Therefore, a player of a game in a Metaverse might acquire virtual goods with actual monetary worth, yet a player who plays Mario Kart for ten years would have nothing to show for it. To improve their standing in the Metaverse, these communities become extremely driven and motivated to generate new material, technology, and community activities.</p>



<p>Players also get co-ownership of the systems they use inside the Web3 system. They have additional motivations to further the game&#8217;s growth since they are paid for their efforts by starting companies within the Metaverse the game is housed in.</p>



<p>A variety of opportunities for people to play various games and earn money are made possible by the Metaverse, allowing users to exchange in- and inter-game goods. A player will soon be able to exchange NFT gained while playing one Metaverse game for NFT earned while playing another game, enabling them to utilize NFT across other games and participate more completely. From a player&#8217;s viewpoint, this alters the game experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are some of the trends influencing Web3 gaming? What is the future of the area?</h2>



<p>NFTS is responsible for the Web3 game development company as we know it today. The possibility of employing NFTs for purposes other than art and collectibles is the fascinating aspect of using them in the blockchain gaming industry. Players may compete in our game for resources, including tools, weapons, artifacts, and more. These NFTs come to life rather than merely being visualized.</p>



<p>Many believe decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, will be the next big thing in this industry. A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is run by its entire membership (ex: members of an organization, employees in a company, etc.). These individuals cast votes on choices that affect the organization, including how money is spent.</p>



<p>Several Web3 games use DAOs (teams) as gameplay elements. Instead of a single authority seizing control and establishing the rules, DAOs provide users with great flexibility. In the end, users manage the space and have laws enacted through a smart contract. Everyone who owns a token in a DAO is a co-owner and may influence the organization&#8217;s strategic direction.</p>



<p>Gaming is a great way to introduce people to the idea of DAOs. People are compelled to comprehend the rules, the operation, and the structure of the whole system in the worlds they are playing in because of the immersive nature of gaming. If the DAO is the supporting framework for the game&#8217;s universe, then players will have to understand how it works and show how useful it is for gaming. DAOs will start to be used outside of games for things like enterprises, sports team ownership, and more once people know them and their advantages.</p>

<p><strong>Axie Infinity (AXS), a popular blockchain-based online video game, has reported a significant decrease in participants over the previous several months. The game&#8217;s popularity fell below the level recorded for January 2021, with an average of 701,000 unique players per month during the last 30 days.</strong></p>



<p>Between September 2022 and September 2021, the game based on non-fungible tokens (NFT) lost more than 62% of its average monthly unique players, falling from 1,955,000 to 739,000. The most recent results indicate the significant effect the continuous crypto market decline has had on the game. Axie Infinity has around 850,000 average monthly players as of 30 January 2021, according to statistics gathered by the gaming industry website Activeplayer.io. This was 21.3 percent more than the level recorded on September 30, 2022.</p>



<p>Compared to the number recorded on January 30, 2022, the decline in players is substantially more drastic. On that day, Axie Infinity reached its highest average monthly unique user count of 2.78 million. According to data gathered by Activeplayer.io, this constituted a fivefold increase from the previous recorded level.</p>



<p>Axie Infinity focuses on online player breeding and combat. According to the website, &#8220;you must possess at least three Axies to play the game, and these Axies cost between $250 and $500 on average.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, some really rare Axies might cost substantially more. According to the game&#8217;s creator, the most expensive Axle ever sold cost $820,000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="364" src="https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/metaverse-1.jpg?resize=640%2C364&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-30818" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/metaverse-1.jpg?w=737&amp;ssl=1 737w, https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/metaverse-1.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p><strong>Blockchain games and Metaverse projects seem to be coping with the bear market a lot better than other niches of the market.</strong></p>



<p>The bear market weeds out unnecessary frills and enables legitimate projects to stand out but also cripples portfolios of investors, both big and small. The ongoing market conditions are no different. But one vertical that market participants remain bullish on is ‚Äì blockchain games and metaverse projects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Winner in Bear Market</h2>



<p>According to DappRadar‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/how-blockchain-users-reacted-to-the-crypto-contagion-and-the-latest-macro-events" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, blockchain games&nbsp;<a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/how-blockchain-users-reacted-to-the-crypto-contagion-and-the-latest-macro-events" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have</a>&nbsp;sidestepped the ensuing bear market and instead ramped up their count by 9.51% in the second quarter of the year. In fact, $2.5 billion were invested in both Q1 and Q2.</p>



<p>June will go down in the history as the worst month for the industry, and even the blockchain gaming space felt the pain registering the lowest per month investment with only $500 million. Weighing on the latest figures, DappRadar‚Äôs CEO Skirmantas Januskas commented,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>‚ÄúWe think that blockchain gaming is going to be key in the next two or three years and is going to bring at least 100 million new users into crypto, for one simple reason, they connect NFTs and DeFi. With all three combined, blockchain gaming, NFTs and DeFi you will see something genuinely new and exciting.‚Äù</em></p></blockquote>



<p>The report highlighted a decline of 7% in users‚Äô wallet (UAW) activity since Q1. This essentially indicated that users continue to engage with blockchain decentralized applications at roughly the same rate as before the Terra implosion. Simultaneously, the amount of gaming-associated NFT transactions have taken a hit by 51% since Q1. The sales volume has also fallen by 82%.</p>



<p>Besides, the total number of transactions sent to the smart contracts of the gaming sector is way higher than other categories such as DeFi, gambling, exchanges, and marketplaces. Throughout this month as well, transactions in gaming have¬†<a href="https://dappradar.com/industry-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed</a>¬†to stay above 24 million per day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Attractive Blockchain for Devs?</h2>



<p>DappRadar revealed that Solana has attracted many NFTs and game developers. This trend can be attributed to low-cost transactions and efficient processing speeds. Despite multiple network outages, blockchain activity has increased by an astonishing 311%.</p>



<p>Owing to the ‚Äúvibrant gaming community,‚Äù WAX has also seen significant traction. Since May, its blockchain activity has grown by 6%.</p>



<p>Demographic-wise, Decentraland holds most popularity in North America, as well as in countries like Austria, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, and Lichtenstein. Axie Infinity, on the other hand, has managed to allure users in Central and South American countries. Meanwhile, Sandbox has garnered popularity in China. The fantasy football game, Sorare has gained a foothold in countries like France, Italy, and Switzerland, as with many football fans across Europe.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="360" src="https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/axie-infinity.jpg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-26535" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/axie-infinity.jpg?w=764&amp;ssl=1 764w, https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/axie-infinity.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/axie-infinity.jpg?resize=267%2C150&amp;ssl=1 267w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p><strong>The CEO blamed some media outlets for focusing only on speculations while ignoring the achievements reached by his firm months after the $620m Ronin hack.</strong></p>



<p>Trung Nguyen ‚Äì Co-Founder and CEO of Axie Infinity ‚Äì said the accusations against him of being engaged in insider trading are ‚Äúbaseless and false.‚Äù However, he admitted transferring $3 million worth of AXS to ‚Äúensure that short-sellers would not be able to front-run the news.‚Äù</p>



<p>In March this year, Ronin Bridge ‚Äì an Ethereum sidechain built for the popular blockchain-based game Axie Infinity ‚Äì¬†became¬†the victim of one of the largest cryptocurrency hacks ever. Bad actors breached its security and drained over 173,000 ETH. The assets equaled more than $600 million at the time.</p>



<p>The attack quickly grabbed society‚Äôs attention, while numerous agencies carried out investigations to find out who stood behind it. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)¬†estimated¬†that the perpetrator is the notorious North Korean hacking group ‚Äì the Lazarus Group.</p>



<p>Despite the multi-million theft, Axie Infinity‚Äôs team¬†promised¬†to reimburse affected clients. Last month, Ronin Bridge restarted its operations with all user funds returned.</p>



<p>And when all seemed like a bad memory from the crypto‚Äôs past, a recent coverage by Bloomberg accused Trung Nguyen ‚Äì Chief Executive Officer of Axie Infinity ‚Äì of moving $3 million worth of AXS from the platform to Binance hours before the incident.</p>



<p>The CEO was quick to respond to those charges. In a series of¬†tweets, he said this story ‚Äúincludes speculation of insider trading.‚Äù Touching upon the $3 million transfer, he said it indeed occurred, but its goal was to stop AXS short sellers from front-running the news.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As many of you know, I prefer to operate behind the scenes, but there is a story that dropped today that I want to address with the community, personally.</p>&mdash; Trung Nguyen (@trungfinity) <a href="https://twitter.com/trungfinity/status/1552723314715623425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 28, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Nguyen further stated that the Founding Team even moved $7.5 million from an Axie multi-sig wallet to Ronin Network to ease the turbulence caused by the hack.</p>



<p>Subsequently, the executive said he is proud of the fact that operations have been restored and all victims received their stolen funds, hinting that this news did not ‚Äúfit the predetermined narratives‚Äù of some media outlets.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>‚ÄúMy life‚Äôs work is Axie Infinity and the community we‚Äôve created together. I take ownership of the security breach and will use it as a learning experience,‚Äù Nguyen concluded.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Binance Recovered Some of the Losses</h2>



<p>A month after the attack, Changpeng Zhao ‚Äì CEO of Binance ‚Äì¬†informed¬†that his company retrieved almost $6 million of the $620 million stolen from the Lazarus Group:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>‚ÄúThe DPRK hacking group started to move their Axie Infinity stolen funds today. Part of it made to Binance spread across over 86 accounts. $5.8M has been recovered. We have done this many times for other projects in the past, too.‚Äù</em></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Joyride Games, Inc., a Web3 game publishing platform designed to build, launch and operate blockchain-powered games, today announced the launch of its casual games platform on Flow, the industry-leading blockchain designed to support consumer-scale decentralized applications. </strong></p>



<p>Joyride‚Äôs first casual mainstream game that brings the power of games on Web3 to everyone is¬†<em>Solitaire Blitz</em>, racking up >500,000 active users in its first four weeks after launch, becoming a Top 10 blockchain game overall by volume and users and the top game on the Flow blockchain according to DappRadar.</p>



<p>Joyride‚Äôs platform for game creators is based on technology that has powered 300 million+ players and top grossing titles on mobile over the past decade. It provides a comprehensive solution to the needs of independent Unity developers as they design, launch, and scale blockchain games with player-owned assets and economies.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe evaluated blockchain protocols against our needs as a games platform for consumers and found that Flow provides us an excellent solution to on-board users easily and to grow with our ecosystem and player community,‚Äù said Omar Siddiqui, CEO and Founder of Joyride. ‚ÄúWe are excited to launch&nbsp;<em>Solitaire Blitz</em>&nbsp;on Flow to onboard the next billion users to blockchain.‚Äù</p>



<p>‚ÄúJoyride has built a comprehensive platform to power Web3 games for creative game developers on Unity,‚Äù added Mickey Maher, SVP of Partnerships at Dapper Labs. ‚ÄúWe share a similar vision to bring the benefits of blockchain to everyone, so we are excited to see them focus on powering the next generation of games and doing so at scale, such as with&nbsp;<em>Solitaire Blitz</em>.‚Äù</p>



<p><em>Solitaire Blitz</em>&nbsp;is a polished version of the popular Klondike Solitaire card game, with an updated look, quirky twists and a variety of modes for different types of players. Fans can enjoy relaxing game sessions or compete in tournaments and leagues and earn $RLY tokens. The title has been in beta for the past few months, with thousands of players already spending 40+ minutes/day playing the title in beta.&nbsp;<em>Solitaire Blitz&nbsp;</em>launched on Flow main-net in early June with players able to play directly on blockchain and has quickly grown to 500k+ active users. The app is currently a Top 10 Blockchain Game overall and No. 1 Dapp on Flow.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe are excited about the early performance of the game, both from an engagement and a technical perspective,‚Äù added Omar Siddiqui. ‚ÄúWe look forward to growing the title further with our public launch and bringing Web3 gaming to a mass, casual audience that loves playing, relaxing, and competing in classic Solitaire.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Otherside, the much-anticipated metaverse gaming platform from the creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, is open for business ‚Äì&nbsp;at least for the owners of a land plot.</strong></p>



<p>On Saturday, the Yuga Labs-developed game invited 4,300 players‚Äîso-called ‚ÄúVoyagers‚Äù‚Äîfor a first-look tech demo and tour of the immersive, ape avatar-navigated online platform. All Otherside players will be required to embark on or view one of these ‚ÄúFirst Trips‚Äù to be able to participate in the game, which has still not yet fully debuted.</p>



<p>All 4,300 players who took part in yesterday‚Äôs digital excursion to the ‚ÄúBiogenic Swamp&#8217;‚Äù that constitutes the center of Otherside were owners of ‚ÄúOtherdeeds,‚Äù deeds to plots of digital land within the platform. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://otherside.xyz/litepaper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">litepaper</a>&nbsp;released shortly after yesterday‚Äôs First Trip, Otherside‚Äôs developers announced that only Otherdeed owners and ‚Äúselected third-party developers‚Äù will be permitted to participate in the game during its first phase.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BR3AKING: <a href="https://twitter.com/OthersideMeta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@OthersideMeta</a> holders have tested a trip to the Otherside with 4300+ users. <a href="https://t.co/J9tyNaa2VO" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/J9tyNaa2VO</a></p>&mdash; The Metaverse (@themetav3rse) <a href="https://twitter.com/themetav3rse/status/1548347709899255808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 16, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to the litepaper, ‚ÄúPhase 1‚Äù will see Otherdeed owners navigate Voyager‚Äôs Journey, an 11-part narrative game ‚Äúsurrounding a mysterious Obelisk that has appeared in the Otherside universe.‚Äù In Phase 1, Otherdeed owners will be able to contribute to the platform‚Äôs construction and shape its core capabilities as co-developers, via the Otherside Development Kit, the platform‚Äôs suite of creation tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe believe in the extraordinary power of community and have seen firsthand how it can be a significant force for good in this industry,‚Äù the litepaper stated. ‚ÄúWe aim to incentivize, empower, and recognize the expression, creativity, and ingenuity of Otherside‚Äôs community of contributors.‚Äù</p>



<p>The litepaper also doubled down on Otherside‚Äôs commitment to interoperability: the ability for digital assets to freely traverse the many digital neighborhoods, or gaming platforms, that potentially one day could constitute the avatar-navigated metaverse. Proponents of an ‚Äúopen metaverse,‚Äù like Yuga Labs, see interoperability as key to the ethos of a democratized and accessible future internet. Such advocates have been vocal about the risk posed by mega corporations like Meta (formerly Facebook),&nbsp;which may attempt to keep their metaverse offerings firmly bordered, in order to retain control over users‚Äô data and analytics.</p>



<p>On Friday, Gordon Goner, one of Yuga Labs‚Äô co-founders, said in a Tweet that Otherside is in direct competition with Web2 ‚Äúgiants,‚Äù but expressed optimism that ‚Äúthe future will bend toward the open, interoperable metaverse.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Making something iteratively, with participation from the community along the way and at each milestone, feels like the only authentic way to build a true metaverse.</p>&mdash; GordonGoner.eth (@GordonGoner) <a href="https://twitter.com/GordonGoner/status/1548058794046869510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The fact that Otherside is currently only accessible to its digital landowners distinguishes it from other leading metaverse platforms, which are open to all internet users. The cheapest Otherdeeds on the market are currently selling for 2.8 ETH, or just shy of $3,800, according to data from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/otherdeed-for-otherside" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinGecko</a>. Many are much more expensive. When Otherdeeds launched in April, in a frenzied 24-hour sale&nbsp;that generated $561 million in sales&nbsp;and&nbsp;severely clogged the Ethereum network, that floor price was $5,800.</p>



<p>Exclusivity&nbsp;and&nbsp;extremely high financial barriers to entry&nbsp;are key components of the recipe that has made Yuga‚Äôs Bored Ape Yacht Club perhaps the most popular and recognizable NFT brand in the world. Yesterday‚Äôs announcement highlights the potential tension between that spirit of scarcity and Yuga‚Äôs stated desire to make Otherside central to the fight for an ‚Äúopen metaverse.‚Äù</p>



<p>For now, Otherside might be considered the metaverse‚Äôs most prominent gated community.</p>
