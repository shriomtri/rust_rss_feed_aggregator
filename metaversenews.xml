<p><em><strong>Ever wished you could build a Video Game? Me too, so let&#8217;s do it together! <meta charset="utf-8">Grab your AVATAR and Help Up Build a FREAKIN VIDEO GAME!</strong></em></p>



<p>This is how Koingames, a tiny game development company, begins their sales pitch, and what a fantastic project! When the author of this essay was a little lad, he sat and drew and coded small games on his old Windows XP, and I recall thinking: &#8220;How cute!&#8221; However, koingame&#8217;s new NFTs project looks to be able to achieve this. Because it could not be nice to be a part of the game you play and to own a piece of it? This is precisely what you are capable of here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the aspects of My Neighbor Alice&#8217;s vision that fascinates players the most is that it is an entrepreneurial sandbox. The game&#8217;s economy is governed by the players, and their interactions generate a thriving economy full with opportunities. Beginners with a little budget can take use of these options, as well as advanced users with a large budget. Here are some examples of how you can start your own business in MNA:</p>



<p>Farming (or employing others to farm your property for you) is a good way to get money.<br>All farming takes place on land parcels that are represented by NFTs purchased through lotteries. You can cultivate crops on your land and sell them to other people if you&#8217;re one of the lucky ones who managed to get any! Planting and cultivating crops is a delightful hobby in and of itself – just remember to water them! If all of that effort is too much for you, you can just rent out your land to another person and profit from the rental income.</p>

<p><strong>Recognizing your animals&#8217; powers<br></strong>Animals are unique NFTs that found new homes earlier this year at our first farm animal adoption event, with additional animal adoption events planned in the future. Animals have the ability to make new objects out of different materials. These created resources are normally more valuable in trade, and they can even be used to create one-of-a-kind goods. Every animal has its own unique crafting ability, some of which are more rare than others. When you harvest organic cotton from your property, for example, some animals will assist you in spinning the cotton into a thread. Other animals can weave the thread into fabric, and special creatures can dye the fabric in the colors you choose. You may either sell these materials or use them to create your own unique clothing!</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="354" src="https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3006" srcset="https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download-1.png 850w, https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download-1-300x125.png 300w, https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download-1-770x321.png 770w, https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download-1-293x122.png 293w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p><strong>completing tasks that have been assigned by other players<br></strong>If you do not yet own any property or animals, you may be able to earn your first money by working for landowners. They may require your assistance in tending to their crops or caring for their animals. Lands require watering and care, while animals want food, water, and a lot of love and attention! Lands that are well-kept produce greater harvests, and animals that are well-kept are significantly better at crafting, making your assistance useful to a landowner.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Arbitrage of resources<br></strong>Traveling across the many players&#8217; territories is a wonderful voyage in and of itself; you&#8217;ll meet new individuals and see their creations, farms, animals, and furniture. If you&#8217;re lucky, you might find that certain materials are less expensive in one location than in another. These characteristics allow you to play the role of a trader, buying and selling products all across the world for a profit!<br>Rental and ownership of animals<br>You might want to enter into the realm of animal ownership if you&#8217;ve made enough money doing jobs or as a traveling merchant. Animals can be owned in MNA, and they can reside on land that you rent from another player. You can now create and sell your own resources on the market. You can also outsource your animals&#8217; talents to other players when you are not utilizing them.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Creating and designing one-of-a-kind things and outfits<br></strong>You can get a decent price by trading commodities, but do you know what gets you an even better deal? Making something special! You may find yourself constructing fashionable sweaters, swift shoes, attractive outfits, and a plethora of hats as you progress through the many stages of animal crafting. These are all one-of-a-kind goods that gamers can wear to show off their individual style. The more distinctive and fascinating a design is, the higher the market price it can command! Because each piece of apparel you make is a one-of-a-kind NFT, you can exchange it with other players.<br>As you can see, our game world is set up to provide players with a variety of methods to profit from their work. As one of Alice&#8217;s new neighbors, how will you build your fortune?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have written a lot about Sandbox on Metaverse News, as it is one of the pioneers behind the new internet and the Decentralized Metaverse, and we will continue to do so. In this post, we&#8217;ll take a look at the people who help wizards and sorceresses work their magic: <strong><em><a href="https://twitter.com/Indexgamehk?t=4oh3pD46nFYgdukRJIk1Ow&amp;s=09" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/Indexgamehk?t=4oh3pD46nFYgdukRJIk1Ow&amp;s=09">Index  Game</a></em></strong> is a Hong Kong-based metaverse gaming company. TheSandbox Decentralized Metaverse is the first Hong Kong studio to build experiences for the platform. Having no official website for INDEX GAME makes it difficult to acquire information about the company. It was discovered that they were accepting employment applications from this domain: https://indexhk.com/ Thus, a website is currently under construction. This community can see and feel that they are fairly active on Twitter.</p>

<p><strong>On the subject of Sandbox</strong></p>



<p><strong><br></strong>Decentralized virtual worlds, such as The Sandbox, have been driving demand for real estate in virtual worlds because of their collaborations with well-known IP and companies, such as Atari, Rollercoaster Tycoon, The Smurfs, Shaun the Sheep and Binance, among others. More than 40 million people across the world have already downloaded The Sandbox IP, which is built on, to build immersive 3D environments and game experiences, as well as store, exchange, and monetize their creations on the Sandbox Metaverse. Please visit www.sandbox.game for more information and follow us on Twitter, Medium, and Discord for regular updates.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>$SAND</strong></p>



<p><strong><br></strong>On the Ethereum network, the $SAND token is an ERC-20 token. This coin serves as the Sandbox ecosystem&#8217;s principal utility token and major currency. In addition, it acts as a form of governance. ”<br>Purchase and sale of non-fungible assets, such as LAND and ASSETS, will require the use of $SAND tokens in The Sandbox&#8217;s marketplace.<br>Additionally, you&#8217;ll need $SAND in order to participate in the metaverse&#8217;s governance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout its growth, the internet has influenced every area of our lives. Web 2.0, for example, has opened up new worldwide financial innovation opportunities. Gig economies have been a major contributor. Everything from cab booking to home massages to freelance work prospects is now available with a simple click. So much so that by 2023, the gig economy will be worth $455 billion. Web 2.0 continues to hire people with varied skill sets and expertise.</p>



<p>However, web 3.0 is swiftly advancing the internet towards the next era of innovation. As a result, things like gaming as a career are no longer unthinkable for most people. The gaming business is huge in the realm of entertainment and has been for a long time. Traditional games are currently valued at $178 billion and are anticipated to reach $268 billion by 2025. Web 3.0 has the ability to drastically revolutionize the interaction between gamers, games, and game makers, among other markets.</p>



<p>Blockchain, cryptography, and tokenization advances are vital in this area. Web 3.0 promotes new economic opportunities, decentralization, and community building. The booming blockchain-cryptocurrency business, with a market valuation of over $2.5 trillion, helps it do this. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a product of this sector, and they have huge significance and scope in digital gaming.</p>



<p>Game worlds are no longer assemblages of immaterial warriors, weaponry, racing vehicles, or anything. A potential economic alternative, especially in economies free of traditional finance&#8217;s excesses, is gaming finance (GameFi). Southeast Asia has established itself as a breeding ground for GameFi ecosystems, which is very important for global economic landscape. But why is this location ideal for GameFi?</p>



<p>GameFi&#8217;s calming influence on uncertainty, inflation, and corruption Southeast Asian economies are typically weak, falling to the dollar, pound, or other first-world currency supremacy. It is also common to see high inflation in these countries.</p>



<p>Covid-19-induced global economic shutdowns have compounded the issue. Over 81 million individuals lost work in Asia-Pacific in the last two years. Worse, there is extreme financial disparity. In Thailand, for example, 1% of the population controls almost 58 percent of the nation&#8217;s wealth and resources. Plus, the ASEAN area has the worst corruption perception index ratings in the world.</p>



<p>So the region&#8217;s poor communities seek new livelihoods and economic models. GameFi has an answer, especially post-pandemic. Play-to-earn (P2E) games rose to the occasion as individuals remained confined to their houses, bereft of traditional income and nourishment.</p>



<p>Games like My DeFi Pet, for example, allowed players to make money and become more than just pastime. During the epidemic, most active P2E gamers were from Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>Gamers were motivated to improve their abilities because they may earn US Dollars. Positive response encouraged the region&#8217;s kids, who earned $1,200 monthly from just one game. Because remittance accounts were inaccessible during the outbreak, many families relied on GameFi for revenue.</p>



<p>Also, companies like Yield Guild Games (YGG) boosted GameFi&#8217;s possibilities. P2E gaming requires in-game NFTs, which some individuals cannot pay. By giving community support and scholarships, YYG overcomes this barrier. Renting metaverse assets adds another layer to their economics.</p>



<p>Tech-savvy but unbanked?</p>



<p>The ASEAN young are particularly tech-savvy, which drives GameFi adoption. Over 90% of the 213 million young people in the region now have mobile internet. However, approximately 290 million people in Southeast Asia remain unbanked, meaning just 18% of the population has access to traditional financial services.</p>



<p>GameFi helps individuals in limbo, while blockchain-based solutions provide access to digital wallets and cross-border payments. The company has also made financial services more inclusive than before, contributing to GameFi&#8217;s entire value offer.</p>



<p>GameFi also provides liquidity to in-game assets, enabling off-chain transactions. Gamers may use their gaming assets offline in a variety of ways. Players can fractionalize assets and use them in DeFi protocols.</p>



<p>Others may pledge them as loan collateral or trade them in secondary markets and derivatives markets. GameFi, in a sense, unlocks the hitherto untapped potential of in-game assets, which was previously unreachable.</p>



<p>Finally, Vietnam&#8217;s pivotal role in GameFi&#8217;s progress must be emphasized. GameFi&#8217;s most popular product, Axie Infinity, is Vietnamese. As well as superior to typical blockchains in terms of quick block confirmation, low transaction fees and over ten thousand transactions per second.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrade your Ready Player Me avatar and play Hoverball on Metaboard. CARV has unveiled the CARV1 Metaboard, a digital collectable hoverboard.</strong></p>



<p>Each Metaboard uses avatar integration based on the metaverse platform and includes bespoke avatar movements and improvements. The hoverboard&#8217;s physics system lets you execute stunts and optimizes items per metaverse.</p>



<p>Nathan Grotticelli, CEO of CARV, said individuals use Metaboards to travel 3D model terrains in ever-growing virtual worlds.</p>



<p>With hovering, you can surf ocean waves, snowy slopes, and concrete skateparks. Grotticelli adds, &#8220;We&#8217;re pushing out sample examples, including 3D scans of real-world riding spots.&#8221;</p>



<p>The inaugural CARV1 collection will include 50 super-rad designs with varying rarity and speed. 500 limited edition 3D elements are included. The business now limits sales to two per consumer, but hopes to increase that later this year.</p>



<p>Your Ready Player Me avatar may utilize Metaboards in any supported world. CARV has agreements with 15 additional apps/companies to integrate soon.</p>



<p>Virtual hoverboards aren&#8217;t a fad. LEVRTV lets you ride your board in the showroom. The CARV team encourages signing up on their website to obtain a direct link delivered to your email if you&#8217;re interested in checking out the app.</p>



<p>Grotticelli sees avatars using Metaboards to watch live-action 360 and volumetric video with better vertical control and less dizziness.</p>



<p>Owners may market boards to other collectors, ride over 3D terrain (including NeRFs), and engage in the Hoverball eSport championship. A tweet teases AR.</p>



<p>We enable freestyle stunts and Hoverball, a VR-first esport. Our teammate&#8217;s past experience selling hoverboards in Secondlife 10 years ago inspired this. People liked cruising and jumping, but their Rocket-league/Quidditch-esq Simball gaming was popular, says Grotticelli.</p>



<p>CARV intends a skate/street artist drop for their Metaboards. CARV 2 will contain a detachable virtual drone camera and new rider contests.</p>



<p>Metaboards cost 777 Matic (Polygon). CARV will soon accept USD and ETH.</p>

<p>I must honestly admit that I was somewhat surprised when I read this news on Reuters. Maybe it&#8217;s because the &#8220;Woke&#8221; wave has not reached the same height as it has in the states, but I think it sounded a bit wild that one could raise such amounts. But, it is not it stood less what DNABlock has succeeded with.</p>



<p>DNABlock produced projects for TV networks such as Fox and Apple TV+ and prominent video games, music labels, fashion designers, and award shows. DNABlock uses Epic Games&#8217; Unreal Engine-based MetaHuman Creator. to design avatars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virtual reality in the metaverse creates opportunities. Would anyone buy a virtual property for $200,000? Indeed. Already, many have.</p>



<p>PwC, Samsung, and HSBC have bought virtual estate, not only Snoop Dogg. JPMorgan built a metaverse branch. According to<strong><em><a href="https://twitter.com/metametric_" title=" MetaMetric Solutions,"> MetaMetric Solutions,</a></em></strong> metaverse real estate acquisitions surpassed $500 million in 2021 and could treble this year.</p>



<p><strong><em><a href="https://xclusiverse.com/about-us" title="Xclusiverse">Xclusiverse</a></em></strong> bets on this demand. The company connects brokers, owners, sellers, and purchasers of digital and real-world properties.</p>



<p><strong><em><a href="https://unicorpcapital.com/" title="Unicorp Capital'">Unicorp Capital&#8217;</a></em></strong>s first phase of the platform allows land brokers and developers to market their properties online. The next step, in September 2022, will allow metaverse property purchases.</p>



<p>Real estate is challenged by tech and digital transformation. Realtors lack inventory and scalability. Florina Onetiu, co-founder of Unicorp Capital, told Arab News they don&#8217;t see rich digital marketing tactics, improved sales methods, or immersive learning experiences.</p>



<p>&#8220;The real estate business can address actual challenges online by developing a community to buy and sell property securely,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>True-up</p>



<p>Realtors can buy a yearly membership to Xclusiverse, which includes virtual office space. Individual business demands can be met.</p>



<p>When? Metaverse business is booming. Onetiu predicts annual sales growth of 44%.</p>



<p>The increase is due to its popularity, COVID-19, augmented or virtual reality, and the practical usage of metaverse to buy digital assets with crypto and non-fungible tokens. Everything skyrocketed when Facebook released metaverse last year, she noted.</p>



<p><strong><em><a href="https://metaversenews.com/?s=facebook" title="Facebook rebranded as Meta in October 2021">Facebook rebranded as Meta in October 2021</a></em></strong>, focusing on the metaverse. November real estate sales rose to $113 million, according to MetaMetric. Grayscale, a crypto asset management, anticipated a $1 trillion digital market.</p>



<p>According to a JP Morgan research, the average price of virtual land doubled in six months in 2021, reaching $12,000 across the four largest metaverse platforms in December 2021. According to Republic Realm, approximately 60% of virtual land transactions in 2022 were in Sandbox. Warner Music, Gucci, and Snoop Dogg bought Sandbox virtual assets.</p>



<p>Buying virtual land is anchored on blockchain, a decentralized concept where no bank or government may enforce laws. Dubai is enacting legislation to protect virtual assets and assist this emerging industry.</p>

<p>“The UAE is among the authorities willing to regulate fledgling technology used to produce, buy, or sell virtual assets. This boosts our plan.&#8221;</p>



<p>The UAE&#8217;s Virtual Assets Law does not explain how virtual assets would be controlled, he said. The Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority&#8217;s mandate is to regulate virtual assets, and &#8220;we expect the first set of regulations by Q2 2022.&#8221;</p>



<p>Self-funded startup Xclusiverse is seeking capital in June to scale business operations and bring real estate into the digital age. The proposal involves making it easier to buy virtual assets online and closing real-world deals virtually. Every member broker will have a metaverse office.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web3, the current buzzword, is almost certainly familiar to everyone who&#8217;s heard of non-fungible tokens (<strong><em><a href="https://metaversenews.com/category/nft/" title="NFT">NFT</a></em></strong>). These two terms were coined by blockchain proponents and crypto enthusiasts, who believe that blockchain is the Internet&#8217;s next big thing.</p>



<p>According to Elon Musk, the phrase is a &#8220;commercial buzzword than reality right now,&#8221; but a closer examination reveals it might have far-reaching implications for our international economy and even our Internet infrastructure. When it comes to Web3, I&#8217;d like to know a little more about it before jumping to conclusions.</p>



<p></p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Web3</strong></p>



<p>Web3 is the underlying concept of cryptocurrency generation, which is basically decentralisation. Cryptocurrency-related technologies, such as blockchain and cryptography, will also play a critical role in Web3.</p>



<p>As with Web2, Web3 aims to make the Internet more inclusive, but without ceding power to large firms such as Facebook, Google, or Amazon. It intends to accomplish this goal through decentralizing the Internet.</p>

<p>Mat Dryhurst, a Berlin-based artist and proponent of the Web3 revolution, explains, &#8220;There is a tiny group of firms who own all this technology, and then there are those of us who utilize it, and despite the fact that we contribute to the success of these platforms, we get nothing in return.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, how would Web3 empower users to take control of the Internet? With the emergence of cryptocurrencies, we&#8217;re already witnessing a peek of how Web3 will operate. Bitcoin, for example, does not belong to anybody, and the data on the Bitcoin network is not centralized; it is distributed throughout the network.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Web3 in the rest of 2022</strong></p>



<p><strong><br></strong>While the notion of Web3 is not completely established, platforms embodying the concept currently exist and are providing opportunities for cooperation and revenue for individuals. Decentralised autonomous organizations (DAO), DeFi platforms, crypto gaming platforms, and even the metaverse are all examples of such platforms.</p>



<p>However, because these platforms are so new and intricate, there are financial and educational obstacles to entry. Thus, the first step in becoming acquainted with Web3 will be to acquire knowledge, such as how to navigate the world of non-fungible tokens.<br>While Web3 is a relatively new idea, there is plenty of information about it on the Internet, and a fast Google search may reveal a wealth of information.</p>



<p>On the other hand, when it comes to generating money using Web3, a fast Internet search may not suffice. Gaming, on the other hand, appears to be the least hazardous method to benefit from the new Internet iteration.</p>



<p>Through their scholarship program, platforms like as the Metaverse Magna have made it simple for Africans to earn from crypto gaming. It enables gamers to participate on cryptocurrency gaming sites such as Axie Infinity, where they may earn up to $2,000 each month. Additionally, a job in Web3 is another way to earn from it in 2022. Experts in web3 and blockchain are in great demand, given the industry is still in its infancy. Dapp University is an excellent resource for learning about professions in Web3.</p>



<p>While Web3 may appear to be the gleaming new future of the Internet, only time will tell whether it lives up to its numerous promises.</p><p>The post <a href="https://metaversenews.com/web3-will-be-the-next-stage-of-the-internets-growth/">Web3 will be the next stage of the Internet’s growth</a> first appeared on <a href="https://metaversenews.com">Metaverse News</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
