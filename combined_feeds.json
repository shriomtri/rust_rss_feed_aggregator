    "pub_date": "Thu, 27 Oct 2022 09:42:06 +0000",
    "encoded_content": "\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/metaverse.jpg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-30680\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/metaverse.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/metaverse.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/fintechs.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/metaverse.jpg?resize=267%2C150&amp;ssl=1 267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the Metaverse?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the Metaverse&#8217;s tokens, users may become co-owners of the peer-to-peer digital environment known as the Metaverse. Using the Metaverse, people may add additional value, relationships, and chances to their actual life. The area is adaptable and may be used for anything where connection and community produce value, including networking, business, communications, the arts, and education, in addition to gamification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A user experience with little or no barriers to interoperability across games, economy, digital assets, art, and education is made feasible by the Metaverse development company. Users are empowered by its decentralized structure to produce valuable things in this new society and reap the benefits of their labor and freely trade their digital assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What do companies need to know about the Metaverse, And why is it relevant to businesses?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Metaverse presents prospects for companies in terms of technology, the economy, and community building for their clients. Businesses may change how they relate to their clients, due to the Metaverse. Companies will be able to develop more enduring and widespread connections with consumers via the Metaverse based on shared ownership, motivation, and experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some methods that companies may make money from the Metaverse?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some monetization strategies may have a tenuous connection to gaming. For instance, in some Metaverses, community members have established enterprises that enable them to make money by developing in-game gameplay techniques. Enterprises may also generate revenue by distributing authority and ownership to members of their communities or organizations, empowering them to establish their sub-entities and businesses and eventually enhancing the value of the larger enterprise. At this point in the Metaverse&#8217;s development, there is a lot of discovery taking place, and business models are being created, tried out, and refined quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Certain industries or firms stand to gain the most from the Metaverse?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due in large part to the rich gameplay features the Metaverse offers gaming communities, blockchain games, and their players have so far benefited the most from it. Due to the expanding community of builders and players who have flocked to Metaverses in little under two years, Groups of individuals from all around the globe may improve their economic and social situation due to the Metaverse communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the main factors influencing the growth of the Metaverse?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The epidemic made it more important for individuals to interact globally, even outside social media. The purpose of the Metaverse, created to do just that, is to improve digital interactions meaningfully. In the Metaverse, there is a place for everyone, and individuals are naturally drawn to changes that will enhance their life. Previously, the development of the Metaverse was based on many of the same principles that led to the established social media sites like Myspace, Facebook, and Instagram. It has increased our ability to connect, network, and communicate while still utilizing the tools we have used.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What role does Web3 recreate in the Metaverse?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Web3 refers to the stage of the internet where tokenization has made users co-owners of platforms. Contrast this with Web2, the period of the internet when people shared material but did not share ownership. Because decentralized networks provide co-ownership to all members, which is a need for the shared digital space known as the Metaverse, the Metaverse and Web3 depend on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What modifications are Web3 and the Metaverse making to the gaming sector?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond anything, we could have anticipated with Web2 or the current edition of the internet, Web3 has expanded the possibilities for gaming. It has made it possible for games that let players earn tokens as they play‚Äîtickets that have value and function in the real world‚Äîto be developed. Therefore, a player of a game in a Metaverse might acquire virtual goods with actual monetary worth, yet a player who plays Mario Kart for ten years would have nothing to show for it. To improve their standing in the Metaverse, these communities become extremely driven and motivated to generate new material, technology, and community activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Players also get co-ownership of the systems they use inside the Web3 system. They have additional motivations to further the game&#8217;s growth since they are paid for their efforts by starting companies within the Metaverse the game is housed in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A variety of opportunities for people to play various games and earn money are made possible by the Metaverse, allowing users to exchange in- and inter-game goods. A player will soon be able to exchange NFT gained while playing one Metaverse game for NFT earned while playing another game, enabling them to utilize NFT across other games and participate more completely. From a player&#8217;s viewpoint, this alters the game experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some of the trends influencing Web3 gaming? What is the future of the area?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NFTS is responsible for the Web3 game development company as we know it today. The possibility of employing NFTs for purposes other than art and collectibles is the fascinating aspect of using them in the blockchain gaming industry. Players may compete in our game for resources, including tools, weapons, artifacts, and more. These NFTs come to life rather than merely being visualized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many believe decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, will be the next big thing in this industry. A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is run by its entire membership (ex: members of an organization, employees in a company, etc.). These individuals cast votes on choices that affect the organization, including how money is spent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several Web3 games use DAOs (teams) as gameplay elements. Instead of a single authority seizing control and establishing the rules, DAOs provide users with great flexibility. In the end, users manage the space and have laws enacted through a smart contract. Everyone who owns a token in a DAO is a co-owner and may influence the organization&#8217;s strategic direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaming is a great way to introduce people to the idea of DAOs. People are compelled to comprehend the rules, the operation, and the structure of the whole system in the worlds they are playing in because of the immersive nature of gaming. If the DAO is the supporting framework for the game&#8217;s universe, then players will have to understand how it works and show how useful it is for gaming. DAOs will start to be used outside of games for things like enterprises, sports team ownership, and more once people know them and their advantages.</p>\n",

Axie Infinity has around 850,000 average monthly players as of 30 January 2021, according to statistics gathered by the gaming industry website Activeplayer.io. This was 21.3 percent more than the level recorded on September 30, 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the number recorded on January 30, 2022, the decline in players is substantially more drastic. On that day, Axie Infinity reached its highest average monthly unique user count of 2.78 million. According to data gathered by Activeplayer.io, this constituted a fivefold increase from the previous recorded level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Axie Infinity focuses on online player breeding and combat. According to the website, &#8220;you must possess at least three Axies to play the game, and these Axies cost between $250 and $500 on average.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, some really rare Axies might cost substantially more. According to the game&#8217;s creator, the most expensive Axle ever sold cost $820,000.</p>\n",

The ongoing market conditions are no different. But one vertical that market participants remain bullish on is ‚Äì blockchain games and metaverse projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Winner in Bear Market</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to DappRadar‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dappradar.com/blog/how-blockchain-users-reacted-to-the-crypto-contagion-and-the-latest-macro-events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report</a>, blockchain games&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dappradar.com/blog/how-blockchain-users-reacted-to-the-crypto-contagion-and-the-latest-macro-events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">have</a>&nbsp;sidestepped the ensuing bear market and instead ramped up their count by 9.51% in the second quarter of the year. In fact, $2.5 billion were invested in both Q1 and Q2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>June will go down in the history as the worst month for the industry, and even the blockchain gaming space felt the pain registering the lowest per month investment with only $500 million. Weighing on the latest figures, DappRadar‚Äôs CEO Skirmantas Januskas commented,</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>‚ÄúWe think that blockchain gaming is going to be key in the next two or three years and is going to bring at least 100 million new users into crypto, for one simple reason, they connect NFTs and DeFi. With all three combined, blockchain gaming, NFTs and DeFi you will see something genuinely new and exciting.‚Äù</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The report highlighted a decline of 7% in users‚Äô wallet (UAW) activity since Q1. This essentially indicated that users continue to engage with blockchain decentralized applications at roughly the same rate as before the Terra implosion. Simultaneously, the amount of gaming-associated NFT transactions have taken a hit by 51% since Q1. The sales volume has also fallen by 82%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, the total number of transactions sent to the smart contracts of the gaming sector is way higher than other categories such as DeFi, gambling, exchanges, and marketplaces. Throughout this month as well, transactions in gaming have¬†<a href=\"https://dappradar.com/industry-overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">managed</a>¬†to stay above 24 million per day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Attractive Blockchain for Devs?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DappRadar revealed that Solana has attracted many NFTs and game developers. This trend can be attributed to low-cost transactions and efficient processing speeds. Despite multiple network outages, blockchain activity has increased by an astonishing 311%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Owing to the ‚Äúvibrant gaming community,‚Äù WAX has also seen significant traction. Since May, its blockchain activity has grown by 6%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demographic-wise, Decentraland holds most popularity in North America, as well as in countries like Austria, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, and Lichtenstein. Axie Infinity, on the other hand, has managed to allure users in Central and South American countries. Meanwhile, Sandbox has garnered popularity in China. The fantasy football game, Sorare has gained a foothold in countries like France, Italy, and Switzerland, as with many football fans across Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/blockchain-games-least-affected-by-market-turmoil-dappradar-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source</a></p>\n",

All Otherside players will be required to embark on or view one of these ‚ÄúFirst Trips‚Äù to be able to participate in the game, which has still not yet fully debuted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All 4,300 players who took part in yesterday‚Äôs digital excursion to the ‚ÄúBiogenic Swamp&#8217;‚Äù that constitutes the center of Otherside were owners of ‚ÄúOtherdeeds,‚Äù deeds to plots of digital land within the platform. In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://otherside.xyz/litepaper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">litepaper</a>&nbsp;released shortly after yesterday‚Äôs First Trip, Otherside‚Äôs developers announced that only Otherdeed owners and ‚Äúselected third-party developers‚Äù will be permitted to participate in the game during its first phase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BR3AKING: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OthersideMeta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@OthersideMeta</a> holders have tested a trip to the Otherside with 4300+ users. <a href=\"https://t.co/J9tyNaa2VO\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/J9tyNaa2VO</a></p>&mdash; The Metaverse (@themetav3rse) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/themetav3rse/status/1548347709899255808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">July 16, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the litepaper, ‚ÄúPhase 1‚Äù will see Otherdeed owners navigate Voyager‚Äôs Journey, an 11-part narrative game ‚Äúsurrounding a mysterious Obelisk that has appeared in the Otherside universe.‚Äù In Phase 1, Otherdeed owners will be able to contribute to the platform‚Äôs construction and shape its core capabilities as co-developers, via the Otherside Development Kit, the platform‚Äôs suite of creation tools.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúWe believe in the extraordinary power of community and have seen firsthand how it can be a significant force for good in this industry,‚Äù the litepaper stated. ‚ÄúWe aim to incentivize, empower, and recognize the expression, creativity, and ingenuity of Otherside‚Äôs community of contributors.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The litepaper also doubled down on Otherside‚Äôs commitment to interoperability: the ability for digital assets to freely traverse the many digital neighborhoods, or gaming platforms, that potentially one day could constitute the avatar-navigated metaverse. Proponents of an ‚Äúopen metaverse,‚Äù like Yuga Labs, see interoperability as key to the ethos of a democratized and accessible future internet. Such advocates have been vocal about the risk posed by mega corporations like Meta (formerly Facebook),&nbsp;which may attempt to keep their metaverse offerings firmly bordered, in order to retain control over users‚Äô data and analytics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Friday, Gordon Goner, one of Yuga Labs‚Äô co-founders, said in a Tweet that Otherside is in direct competition with Web2 ‚Äúgiants,‚Äù but expressed optimism that ‚Äúthe future will bend toward the open, interoperable metaverse.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Making something iteratively, with participation from the community along the way and at each milestone, feels like the only authentic way to build a true metaverse.</p>&mdash; GordonGoner.eth (@GordonGoner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GordonGoner/status/1548058794046869510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">July 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that Otherside is currently only accessible to its digital landowners distinguishes it from other leading metaverse platforms, which are open to all internet users. The cheapest Otherdeeds on the market are currently selling for 2.8 ETH, or just shy of $3,800, according to data from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/otherdeed-for-otherside\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CoinGecko</a>. Many are much more expensive. When Otherdeeds launched in April, in a frenzied 24-hour sale&nbsp;that generated $561 million in sales&nbsp;and&nbsp;severely clogged the Ethereum network, that floor price was $5,800.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exclusivity&nbsp;and&nbsp;extremely high financial barriers to entry&nbsp;are key components of the recipe that has made Yuga‚Äôs Bored Ape Yacht Club perhaps the most popular and recognizable NFT brand in the world. Yesterday‚Äôs announcement highlights the potential tension between that spirit of scarcity and Yuga‚Äôs stated desire to make Otherside central to the fight for an ‚Äúopen metaverse.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, Otherside might be considered the metaverse‚Äôs most prominent gated community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://decrypt.co/105314/yuga-labs-opens-otherside-for-first-trips-in-bored-ape-metaverse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source</a></p>\n",

These assets encompass AURY tokens, playable NFT characters, skins, and Neftie eggs, all of which serve or will serve a utility in Aurory&#8217;s flagship games, Adventures (JRPG) and Tactics (Timeline-Based Battle Arena).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SyncSpace technology plays a pivotal role in making this integration possible. It is a proprietary hybrid on-chain/off-chain inventory management system specifically designed by Aurory. Originally aimed at reducing friction for new users entering the Aurory gaming universe without the need for wallet connections, SyncSpace also allows them to earn in-game items that can later be minted on-chain when withdrawn to an external wallet. Moreover, users can deposit on-chain items into SyncSpace, facilitating seamless gameplay, trading, Neftie egg hatching, Aurorian expeditions, and more without the constant need for blockchain transaction approvals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By leveraging SyncSpace, Aurory now empowers gamers to deposit their assets from the Solana network into SyncSpace and withdraw them on the Arbitrum network and vice versa, ensuring a seamless cross-chain experience. Notably, this innovation also opens the door for Aurory games to integrate with traditional gaming platforms that impose stricter regulations on incorporating blockchain elements.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aurorybanner.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"559\" src=\"https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aurorybanner-1024x559.jpg\" alt=\"Aurory Sets The Stage For Seamless Web3 Gaming With New Integration On Arbitrum\" class=\"wp-image-205908\" srcset=\"https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aurorybanner-1024x559.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aurorybanner-300x164.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aurorybanner-768x419.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aurorybanner-1536x838.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aurorybanner-750x409.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aurorybanner-1140x622.jpg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aurorybanner.jpg 1596w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" title=\"Aurory Sets The Stage For Seamless Web3 Gaming With New Integration On Arbitrum 2\"></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The integration with Arbitrum comes at a time when the network is making substantial strides in the web3 gaming industry. During the first quarter of 2023, Arbitrum witnessed a staggering 125% growth in active blockchain gaming users, thanks to its cutting-edge technological advancements in scaling performance. The Arbitrum Nova scaling solution utilizes &#8220;AnyTrust&#8221; technology, processing data off-chain to enable low-cost transactions, which is particularly beneficial for game developers handling high transaction volumes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arbitrum has been a hotbed of activity lately, attracting prominent projects in the blockchain gaming space.

Each Illuvitar has a power rating based on its rarity, which helps you climb the scoreboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each GameStop x Illuvitar D1SK comes with a one-of-a-kind GameStop-branded Illuvitar with over 108 possible combinations based on six distinct Illuvials, three emotions, three backdrop stages, and two finishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All GameStop D1SK buyers will get early access to both the creature collection game, Illuvium Overworld, and the strategic auto-battler, Illuvium Arena!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Illuvium is a blockchain-based game developed on Ethereum that makes use of the Immutable X network and its Layer-2 scaling mechanism. The role-playing game (RPG) features the creation of 3D cutting-edge characters with real-time character-focused gameplay, all while allowing players to earn in-game non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and stake their tokenized assets in a decentralized, zero-fee framework. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Illuvium also uses a privacy-preserving, highly scalable architecture with Zero-Knowledge Rollups (zk-Rollups). To complement these and other features, the game employs a decentralized governance structure designed to profit from the ecosystem&#8217;s ILV token and the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GameStop, long renowned as a brick-and-mortar game store, moved to crypto a year after the historic r/wallstreetbets short squeeze drove its stock surging in January 2021. GameStop created an NFT and cryptocurrency subsidiary in January 2022.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-299.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-299-1024x628.png\" alt=\"Illuvium Joins A Groundbreaking Partnership With GameStop To Launch NFT\" class=\"wp-image-192303\" srcset=\"https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-299-1024x628.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-299-300x184.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-299-768x471.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-299-750x460.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-299-1140x699.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-299.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" title=\"Illuvium Joins A Groundbreaking Partnership With GameStop To Launch NFT 12\"></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As previously <a href=\"https://news.coincu.com/191525-gamestop-partners-with-the-telos-foundation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reported</a> by Coincu, GameStop has teamed with the Telos Foundation to test a new Web3 game launcher named GameStop Playr.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>DISCLAIMER:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>The information on this website is provided as general market commentary and does not constitute investment advice.

The Ecosystem Fund is assisting in the development of a vibrant ecosystem of Web3 games that can all benefit from each other&#8217;s success by investing in various projects.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-113.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-113.png\" alt=\"Web3 Game Developer COMBO To Launch $80 Million Ecosystem Fund\" class=\"wp-image-191704\" srcset=\"https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-113.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-113-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-113-750x423.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" title=\"Web3 Game Developer COMBO To Launch $80 Million Ecosystem Fund 14\"></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>COMBO is a scaling solution provider for Web3 game development.

Last year, the store even opened its own NFT marketplace, which received almost $5 million in its first week. It announced cooperation with layer 1 blockchain Immutable X in February 2022 to create a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace for exchanging in-game assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The marketplace, which has been in public beta since July, will be open to the public in October 2022. In May 2022, the shop will also unveil its self-custodial crypto and NFT wallet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other gaming organizations are now turning to blockchain technology to help them grow their businesses.

This transaction is completed through a token, which will be locked for two years and will not be included in the commit, so it will not participate in the distribution of benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reportedly, Illuvium is an entirely decentralized collectible and role-playing game built on the Immutable X L2 network. Illuvium is about to launch a public beta with three interactive AAA games: Zero (city builder), Overworld (monster world), and Arena (arena).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded last year by Kieran and Aaron Warwick, this RPG has created a game that rewards players with the chance to discover and capture NFT creatures, known as Illuvials, in combat. The game incentivizes players to have a stake in the project, as the Illuvium network allows in-game fees to be paid out to staked token holders as ongoing rewards.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1687.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"842\" src=\"https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1687.png\" alt=\"Massive Blockchain Game Illuvium Raises Another $10M From Framework Ventures\" class=\"wp-image-191097\" srcset=\"https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1687.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1687-300x247.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1687-768x632.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1687-750x617.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" title=\"Massive Blockchain Game Illuvium Raises Another $10M From Framework Ventures 19\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"> </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In March 2021, Illuvium successfully raised $5 million in a seed round led by one of the oldest venture capital funds in the decentralized finance, Framework Ventures.

As the anticipation grows, let&#8217;s go deep into this exciting development in our favorite open-world action adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several stories have referenced a recent popular <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MatDefies/status/1661820136469176339\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tweet</a> from a gaming content provider as their source for the information, although this tweet lacks proof supporting the allegations and is purely supposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the intricacies of GTA 6&#8217;s gameplay mechanics and microtransactions are undisclosed, experts assume the game will use blockchain technology. This strategy might result in players converting earnings earned during games into real-world currency. According to observers, the reported GTA 6 play-to-earn strategy would feature crypto incentives, which will alter how gamers play and earn.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1460-1024x512.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1460-1024x512.png\" alt=\"GTA 6 Crypto Rumors Are Stirring Players Again\" class=\"wp-image-190267\" srcset=\"https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1460-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1460-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1460-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1460-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1460-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1460-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1460.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" title=\"GTA 6 Crypto Rumors Are Stirring Players Again 21\"></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The new Rockstar Games adventure feature has the potential to turn conventional gaming into an additional source of revenue. According to GTA 6 leaks, the game franchise&#8217;s sixteenth overall chapter will include Bitcoin (BTC) as a payment option and incentive token.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Rockstar Software has not commented on the reported in-game cryptocurrency incentive system, the company has previously confirmed GTA 6&#8217;s development, saying:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">‚ÄúWith the unprecedented longevity of GTA 5, we know many of you have been asking us about a new entry in the Grand Theft Auto series. With every new project we embark on, our goal is always to markedly move beyond what we have previously delivered ‚Äì and we are pleased to confirm that active development for the Grand Theft Auto series‚Äô next entry is well underway.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Take-Two has made crypto steps, like having its Zynga studio work on Web3 games, Rockstar banned NFTs and bitcoin on fan-operated Grand Theft Auto V servers in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The play-to-earn trend has caused quite a stir in the gaming business, transforming what was previously a pastime into a possible money source. In keeping with this developing trend, GTA 6 may include Bitcoin, one of the world&#8217;s biggest crypto assets, as an in-game payment option and reward token. As a result, a progressive game like GTA 6 might provide more complex play-to-earn transactional services using cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>DISCLAIMER: </em></strong><em>The information on this website is provided as general market commentary and does not constitute investment advice.

    "encoded_content": "<p>We are actively monitoring the situation with regards to Coinflex disabling their users withdrawals and the main bridge to and from Smart Bitcoin Cash. </p><p>Coinflex is currently the custodian of the locked bch that pegs bch to sbch at one to one ratio. Given the risk of insolvency at Coinflex, joystick.club will be taking immediate actions to expand to multi-chain as soon as possible to reduce risk to joystick.club and ensure long-term viability of our project irregardless of the situation at coinflex or smart bch. </p><p>For those unaware, because coinflex and smartbch team did not segregate the funds held by coinflex into a secondary foundation or entity, it is possible that in an insolvency and bankruptcy event that the locked BCH funds for smartbch could be paid to creditors leaving sBCH users holding a valueless token without access to its layer1 equivalent.</p><p>We hope the sBCH community will push Coinflex to move those funds into a new foundation or entity&#8217;s multisig controlled by trusted third parties immediately to provide projects and users more assurance that sBCH is fully backed.</p><p>Many projects have been affected by this situation. In the last week we have seen a mad dash to the exits due to decisions made by a private company. SmartBCH community needs to prioritize decentralization in order to continue to attract and retain projects. The market reacted poorly to BCH, FlexUSD (which lost its peg, currently trading at $0.59 to the dollar &#128556;), Flex coin, and even JOY as prices drop across all of smartBCH. </p><p>Thanks to the team at Mistswap and blockNG a new bridge does exist that allows you to exit and enter sBCH via BSC (<a href=\"https://blockng.money/#/bridge\">https://blockng.money/#/bridge</a>). Though it should be mentioned that due to the locked main bridge at Coinflex, and premium for <em>bcUSDT</em> due to many people trying to acquire it, exiting may cost you 10-40%. Please bridge carefully if you should do so. </p><p>We will continue supporting sBCH throughout these times, but demand both sBCH team and Coinflex to resolve this situation asap and move the locked BCH into a separate entity. <strong>&#9888;&#65039; We encourage all of our users to push Coinflex and SmartBCH to move the locked 101,382 BCH (<a href=\"https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/address/qptplw8rl7r7nzmze8mnhrdc3guny3p2ng8vz443qu\">https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/address/qptplw8rl7r7nzmze8mnhrdc3guny3p2ng8vz443qu</a>) into a new multisig held by multiple co-signers not involved in the current Coinflex drama.</strong> This should have been done before launch of sBCH. It is imperative they do this soon to provide projects like Joystick.club the guarantee that our hard work is not at risk.<br>The users of sBCH should never been impacted by the poor decisions of a private corporation. We hope the community and leaders in the community will learn from this. </p><p>Remember, not your keys, not your coins. Please stay tuned for more details on which chain we will be launching next. Will will update our channel as we learn more.</p>",

To play, you just have to match the knob colors to the smart babies bubble color, and try to stay alive!</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf3d06d1-eb79-4921-995c-76541a6afd41_1162x513.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf3d06d1-eb79-4921-995c-76541a6afd41_1162x513.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf3d06d1-eb79-4921-995c-76541a6afd41_1162x513.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf3d06d1-eb79-4921-995c-76541a6afd41_1162x513.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf3d06d1-eb79-4921-995c-76541a6afd41_1162x513.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf3d06d1-eb79-4921-995c-76541a6afd41_1162x513.png\" width=\"1162\" height=\"513\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf3d06d1-eb79-4921-995c-76541a6afd41_1162x513.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:513,&quot;width&quot;:1162,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:278603,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf3d06d1-eb79-4921-995c-76541a6afd41_1162x513.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf3d06d1-eb79-4921-995c-76541a6afd41_1162x513.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf3d06d1-eb79-4921-995c-76541a6afd41_1162x513.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf3d06d1-eb79-4921-995c-76541a6afd41_1162x513.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://prizes.joystick.club/mint/SmartBabies\">Smart Babies NFT</a></figcaption></figure></div><h2>Smart Babies NFT</h2><p>The new game also has integrated into it the Smart Babies NFT, which we <a href=\"https://blog.joystick.club/p/coming-soon-smart-babies-nft-integrated\">recently launched</a> as part of our Smart Babies game.

As part of this, we are minting a whole new NFT series called Smart Babies.</p><h2>Smart Babies NFT</h2><p>We are minting 10,000 Smart Babies that are collectible NFTs which can be staked and farmed on <a href=\"https://joystick.club/\">Joystick.club</a>. In addition to that, the Smart Babies NFTs will be integrated directly into the new game. So if the player has the NFT in their SmartBCH wallet, you will see the Smart Babies NFT in the game giving players more varieties and game options for an interactive gaming experience. </p><p>The new Smart Babies NFT will have seven traits: Skin, Hair, Clothes, Accessories, Face, Background, and Bubble. The NFT drop will have rare specials and it will be 10 JOY to mint the NFTs.</p><div data-component-name=\"Twitter2ToDOM\" class=\"tweet\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/joystickclub/status/1519685171259514880&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;New <span class=\\&quot;tweet-fake-link\\&quot;>#NFT</span> dropping in May on <span class=\\&quot;tweet-fake-link\\&quot;>@SmartBCH</span>\\n\\n&#128124;<span class=\\&quot;tweet-fake-link\\&quot;>#SmartBabies</span> will be minting for 10 $JOY each.

Here are the two options:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Verse Systems arcade game</strong> - Pilot your ship and collect as many VERSE tokens as you can to progress to the next system.

Fast paced and very difficult.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sand Worm arcade game</strong> - Eat all humans who dare cross the sand dunes. Avoid rocks and don't eat your tail. The great worm grows with each human it devours. A familiar but challenging game. Those who have played Snake will understand the mechanics immediately.</p></li></ol><p>You can read more about the two games in the <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/joystickclub.eth/proposal/0x8b259981f0bf1ca78815ee8169af18bf1436f507f9986538b3369f7e9f3e44c4\">governance voting system</a>, where at the bottom of the page you can cast your vote on which game you want us to make and release next. The vote started on April 17, and will end on April 25, 2022. </p><p>The way the voting works is when you go to vote, you are signing a cryptographic message from your SmartBCH address which is connected to how much JOY you hold.

The obvious is that our platform has fun old school style arcade games which any avid gamer will want to take part in for the joy of playing. However, on top of that, we have gamified the platform making use of cryptocurrency to enhance the gaming experience.</p><h3>How do we gamify the arcades?</h3><p>When we say we gamify the arcades, we mean we have several ways to incentivize our users to have a better and more fun experience. For example, we allow gamers to compete for top pole positions and place on our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smart.joystick.club/top_players.php\">leaderboard</a>. We also make use of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smart.joystick.club/\">Bitcoin Cash smart contracts</a>&nbsp;to issue tokens to gamers, such as our native token JOY. All players get rewarded with JOY which can be used on our platform in various ways such as minting NFTs and yield farming (staking) to earn passive income. JOY is also our governance token.</p><p></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55c8dd92-3a5e-4363-81f4-92a42bc1feb0_500x500.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55c8dd92-3a5e-4363-81f4-92a42bc1feb0_500x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55c8dd92-3a5e-4363-81f4-92a42bc1feb0_500x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55c8dd92-3a5e-4363-81f4-92a42bc1feb0_500x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55c8dd92-3a5e-4363-81f4-92a42bc1feb0_500x500.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55c8dd92-3a5e-4363-81f4-92a42bc1feb0_500x500.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/55c8dd92-3a5e-4363-81f4-92a42bc1feb0_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:38819,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Joybot NFT #405&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"Joybot NFT #405\" title=\"Joybot NFT #405\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55c8dd92-3a5e-4363-81f4-92a42bc1feb0_500x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55c8dd92-3a5e-4363-81f4-92a42bc1feb0_500x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55c8dd92-3a5e-4363-81f4-92a42bc1feb0_500x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55c8dd92-3a5e-4363-81f4-92a42bc1feb0_500x500.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Joybot NFT #405</figcaption></figure></div><h3>Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs)</h3><p>A couple of months ago we announced the official Joystick.club NFT, <a href=\"https://prizes.joystick.club/collection\">Joybots</a>.

What followed with <strong>Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic</strong>, <strong>Mass Effect </strong>and <strong>Dragon Age</strong>, were unbelievable success stories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then it all ended: a once great studio taken down by corporate lackeys, prioritizing short-term profits over creativity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a player, I couldn&#8217;t find the passion in the games anymore. And then they killed <strong>Anthem</strong> &#8211; a game that, in my opinion, had an amazing core gameplay, but eventually died because of so much internal mismanagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now today, I can only hope that <strong>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</strong> brings back a shimmer of hope that the old BioWare still exists somewhere. But more importantly, there&#8217;s a flip side to this entire story.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downfall of BioWare, once seen as the epitome of RPG development, left a vacuum that others could fill, and boy did one team manage to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;m talking about <strong>Larian Studios.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Larian Studios was founded in 1996 by <strong>Sven Vincke</strong>, and to this day, more than 25 years later, he continues to personally lead the studio. I have no doubt that this is one of the reasons why they managed to grow as much as they did as a studio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing RPGs, led by a gamer with a passion for RPGs &#8211; it&#8217;s a match made in heaven. One that should be the standard, not the odd exception.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen so many AAA companies in gaming held back by decisions based on business plans and financial motives, completely missing the point of properly addressing the audience; us, the players.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, Vincke is different. Larian Studios is different.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 - Mastering combat\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eF_KAvMImcM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Polemos has launched a YouTube channel dedicated to Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 and RPGs. </em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The making of a masterpiece</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only do they protect their playfulness and creativity at all costs, they even risked the entire company 10 years ago when they went all-in on the Divinity Original Sin Series.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, luckily that first installment was a major success and what followed with Divinity Original Sin 2 is one of the best RPGs ever made to date, a game that screams old BioWare everywhere; the creativity, the writing, the passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, it is no surprise at all that <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong> allowed Larian Studios to use the Baldur&#8217;s Gate IP to create the third installment of the series &#8211; an IP that a lot of developers have tried to get over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What came as a surprise to me though, is what happened next; the development of not only a great game, but a real masterpiece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it wasn&#8217;t developed in secret, behind closed doors. Instead it was hand-in-hand with the community, with us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three years of early access lie behind us. Three years. Larian Studios has proven they understand community management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They listened to feedback, went above and beyond in terms of story depth and kept us entertained through the engaging Panel from Hell showcases. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where else do we see this nowadays in an industry where so many giants have been riddled with scandals, whether that&#8217;s mistreatment of female employees, crunch culture, unfair wages, or simply just the release of incredibly poorly optimized products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you see team members from Larian Studios somewhere, you can feel how excited they are about their job and the opportunity to develop this amazing game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://polemos.io/baldurs-gate-3-is-a-monster-122gb-download/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://polemos.io/baldurs-gate-3-is-a-monster-122gb-download/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3</a> </strong>obviously benefits from its Dungeons &amp; Dragons background. When Covid forced us all inside D&amp;D exploded and reached a popularity that exceeded anything before in the more than 40 years since its release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while that plays a part in today&#8217;s BG3 hype, it isn&#8217;t the reason this game will bring about a new era of RPGs. You just have to look around and follow some of the discussions in the game industry. We have other AAA game developers trying to paint a picture of <strong>Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3</strong> as an anomaly, something we can&#8217;t measure other games against.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Creativity is good for business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But why is that? Larian is a big studio. Sure. And it&#8217;s obvious that teams with a lot less funding and employees might not be able to reach the same complexity and content depth as <strong>Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3</strong> has.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can this be true for other AAA gaming companies, though? I mean, we&#8217;re seeing developers from companies much bigger than Larian join in on the anomaly bandwagon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isn&#8217;t this showing what&#8217;s wrong with the industry? Shouldn&#8217;t we instead all celebrate Larian Studios for pulling off the development of such a masterpiece hand-in-hand with the community on top of that? Shouldn&#8217;t we all take this as a new standard that we strive towards reaching or possibly even exceeding going forward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve had an issue too often in game development where greed and impatience steer directions that should have been determined by creativity and a desire to deliver quality products. Larian Studios took that route of passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They didn&#8217;t take a shortcut. They didn&#8217;t shy away from involving the community and they will be rewarded for this tremendously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve personally played over a hundred hours of Divinity Original Sin 2 and having played nothing but early access of Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 the time of this recording, I can already say that this number will be tiny when I&#8217;m done with all my playthroughs of BG3.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bad games don&#8217;t manage to keep players entertained for that long and delivering bad games will not make it more likely for players to purchase new games of a company either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so excited to see that we still have studios out there that are different. So with this, I want to say thank you, Larian Studios.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for filling the vacuum a struggling BioWare left in the RPG space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for daring to develop a game that pushes boundaries, raises eyebrows, and truly brings an immersive role, role-playing experience into our homes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t you ever change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to keep us players close and to keep your passion as a guiding light for future titles to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And please, please, don&#8217;t you ever let business kill creativity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How Larian Studios made the best RPG ever (hint ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3)\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtofQeQ3QN0?start=85&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n",

    "pub_date": "Fri, 04 Aug 2023 07:14:51 +0000",
    "encoded_content": "\n<p>Back in February, I came to the conclusion that blockchain gaming had to move beyond appealing only to believers in order to succeed. It was clear to me that we were reaching only a handful of people with the blockchain gaming message, we were in effect preaching to a small but passionate choir, and there was a vast gaming public that didn‚Äôt trust, didn‚Äôt understand, or didn‚Äôt care about BG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six months later, my thinking has evolved, and I‚Äôve come to a startling conclusion: it‚Äôs not the world that has to change, it‚Äôs us. In placing all the emphasis on the potential of one revolutionary technology &#8211; the blockchain &#8211; we were missing the point. The message all the most insightful people in the gaming industry were giving me was that the fun comes first. The technology is just part of building the game vehicle. What the vehicle delivers, if it‚Äôs successful, is fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ok, that‚Äôs pretty straightforward. Blockchain tech is an important part of the next wave of gaming &#8211; allowing true ownership of in-game assets, for example &#8211; but it‚Äôs not everything or even the main thing. The main thing is the fun, but that leads to a hard question: what actually is fun?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It‚Äôs difficult to pin down, because activities that in any other circumstance would look like drudgery can actually be fun in games. Micromanagement of resources. Multiple fruitless attempts to kill a boss. Grinding for weeks, months and years to find a sword. If someone paid you to do this stuff, you‚Äôd probably come home angry and unfulfilled every day. But no one is paying you. You‚Äôre doing it for the fun of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like pornography and the famous judicial quote, fun is hard to define, but you know it when you see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the launch of roleplaying game Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 (BG3) <a href=\"https://polemos.io/baldurs-gate-3-is-a-monster-122gb-download/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"252936\">this week</a>. BG3, based on Dungeons and Dragons, is absolutely massive, with a vast world to explore, hundreds of character combinations, 174 hours of cutscenes and a reputed 17,000 possible endings. Polemos co-CEO <strong>Sascha Zehe</strong> is a big fan, and as he explained to me the richness of the game, I began to feel the excitement. BG3 is not a blockchain game, but it is on the cutting edge of game development and it most definitely is fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Why turn-based combat works in Baldur&#039;s Gate 3\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vk-X9BaNGbw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That is why we are covering it. Last week we launched the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Polemos_RPG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Polemos_RPG YouTube channel</a>, with <strong>Sascha</strong> taking the lead on BG3 in video. I have been immersed in a world of races, classes, quests and 20-sided dice. No problem. This is fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same for another YouTube channel we have started &#8211; this time with game expert <strong>Cavan ‚ÄúCaveman‚Äù Roe</strong> taking the lead role &#8211; named <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Polemos_Armored_Core_6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Polemos_Armored_Core_6</a>. In the game, advanced mechs fly through enormous space hangars seeking out and destroying enemies. It is insane, loud and most definitely fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Declassified: The 7 Biggest Leaks in Armored Core 6!\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fwrBzN4TD08?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As we fill out our content offering, we continue to believe that blockchain tech will feature heavily in the next wave of big games, and particularly that asset ownership will become widespread and fundamental to gaming fun in future.

What tickled me was the names of the fake games involved: Brawl Earth, WildWorld, Dawnland, Destruction, Evolion, Pearl, Olymp of Reptiles, and SaintLegend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scams have worked on some people and I think I know why. I reviewed our top 40 list of blockchain games &#8211; the Polemos watch list &#8211; and it‚Äôs clear the fraudsters have been doing their homework. The fake names ring kind-of true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to try my hand, with a little help from GPT4, and came up with another crop of&nbsp; eight imposters: Starweaver, Bitjade, Vortigon, Veriscape, Solarion, Vortex Reverie, FringeLands and my favourite, Neon Ascension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the real Wildcard: significant changes to the combat system have been rolled out.

These are the guys behind the most-traded NFT collections Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and the Otherside virtual land plots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of updates here, most of them typically smart, but there‚Äôs just a hint of desperation in all the activity. Yuga has been hit by the zeitgeist decline of NFTs, and it shows in their numbers: from January, the floor price of BAYC NFTs has halved in real dollar terms. That‚Äôs a big fall, and don‚Äôt forget that in January we already knew all about FTX etc. It feels like existential rot. A new game, a conference in Hong Kong, an actual party in Miami, and an exclusive Otherside demo for a handful for Bored Ape holders do not convince me to the contrary. The only thing I think is really inventive: a licensing deal for people who want to make Bored Ape merchandise (the deal is only available to NFT holders). Of course, that kind of thing only works if the brand still has cultural heft, and unfortunately that may not be the case for much longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This is the online version of our weekly newsletter. <a href=\"https://polemos.io/sign-up-for-the-polemos-newsletter/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"250505\">Sign up</a> to have it delivered to your inbox free every week.</em></p>\n",

CEO <strong>Michael Wagner </strong>said he was reducing his base salary to around $50k, and put his main game &#8211; an Unreal Engine 5 space MMORPG &#8211; on the backburner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a peculiar experience listening to the Star Atlas town hall meeting held two days after the announcement. Wagner is a convincing speaker, and approached what should have been a very difficult meeting with admirable calm. He was pitch-perfect for a community that wanted so badly to hear that the dream wasn‚Äôt dead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here‚Äôs how he began the <a href=\"https://polemos.io/community-quizzes-star-atlas-boss-after-122-sacked/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"252914\">meeting</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúThis is an extremely positive call. I don&#8217;t want this to have a negative overshadow whatsoever.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man who just sacked more than 100 people didn‚Äôt want a ‚Äònegative overshadow‚Äô? This was bold stuff for the first call to a community that has collectively invested tens of millions of dollars into his gaming project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BAU in the slaughterhouse</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/270723_wagner_star_atlas-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-252920\" srcset=\"https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/270723_wagner_star_atlas-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/270723_wagner_star_atlas-300x169.jpg 300w, https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/270723_wagner_star_atlas-768x432.jpg 768w, https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/270723_wagner_star_atlas.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wagner went on to characterise the gutting of the studio team as part of a normal business cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúAll of the biggest tech companies out there in the world are making layoffs right now, the Googles and the Metas. They&#8217;re laying off tens of thousands of people to adjust for the market cycle.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>True. Meta, in particular, has been ruthless in cutting roles as part of the cycle. In two rounds of cuts from the end of 2022, it has cut its global workforce by 24%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Wagner‚Äôs comparison is spurious and it‚Äôs clear what Star Atlas is suffering from isn‚Äôt part of any normal business cycle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start with the magnitude of the cuts: from late 2022, it has cut 81% of its workforce and gone from a very big development team by gaming standards to a medium, non-AAA size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reasons for the financial crisis?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wagner lists:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The loss of $15m on the <a href=\"https://polemos.io/top-ftx-executive-pleads-guilty/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"250515\">FTX collapse</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>An unexpected $30m tax bill</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The devaluation of the ATLAS token leading to a loss of $65m</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a ‚Äúswing of $110m on our balance sheet‚Äù Wagner said during the meeting. The loss of money on FTX is probably the most forgivable of these ills, but I wouldn‚Äôt classify it as part of a normal business cycle. An unprecedented fraud at the cutting edge of finance? Yes, but definitely not BAU.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tax becomes interesting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax bill is fascinating. Wagner ignored a question Polemos game expert Mogglin asked during the meeting about where that bill came from and what it was for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúOf course, we know we have to pay taxes, but it was a $30 million tax bill in 2021, higher than I expected.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could it be that Star Atlas was expecting the money taken in through the sale of tokens would not be taxable? Wagner was very proud of all the money Star Atlas made in the bull market conditions of 2021 &#8211; ‚Äúphenomenal success ‚Ä¶ we never expected making almost $200m over the course of a year and a half‚Äù &#8211; but it‚Äôs possible they viewed the token sales as investments, rather than sales. That would expose Star Atlas to an unexpected tax bill, because fund-raising is not taxable, but sales are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here‚Äôs what one expert advised me on the status of tokens like ATLAS:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If a large number of assets were sold as securities in what approximates an IPO, then they&#8217;d likely be deemed non-taxable and represent a cash infusion. On the other hand, if such assets were sold as traditional goods or commodities, then the seller would pay tax on the profit recognized versus the cost basis.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Star Atlas wouldn‚Äôt want the ATLAS token to be seen as a security (that would have all kinds of legal implications), so it must have been sold as a ‚Äútraditional good or commodity‚Äù and be taxable. You can‚Äôt have it both ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Token accounting</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/030123_staratlas2-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Distance view of the spaceport in the Star Atlas demo\" class=\"wp-image-249198\" srcset=\"https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/030123_staratlas2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/030123_staratlas2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/030123_staratlas2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/030123_staratlas2.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">View of the spaceport in the Star Atlas demo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To miss the fact that you are selling something taxable and rack up a massive tax bill is poor management. Even worse is the third item in the list, the hole in the ‚Äúbalance sheet‚Äù caused by the reduction in the value of ATLAS. This token spiked in September 2021, up to 26 cents, and is now down to fractions of a cent. Wagner patted himself on the back for not selling more of these tokens to the community, keeping them ‚Äúon the balance sheet‚Äù, but this is a confused fantasy. Bear in mind Star Atlas conjured these tokens out of thin air &#8211; they are not shares or investments in the business &#8211; sold some of them, and kept the rest as assets against which they made business plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s make this more concrete with an example: say I mint a million tokens and manage to sell 100 of them for $5 each. It is not sensible to assume the remaining 9,999,900 tokens are worth $5 each. In fact, it is delusional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This kind of circularity is exactly what has triggered collapses elsewhere in crypto, and contributed to its bad name. With no rules around the issuing of tokens, you can do whatever you like with your ‚Äúbalance sheet‚Äù. But reality is going to impinge at some point. Your team are going to want to be paid, and not in ATLAS. So what can you do? In the case of Star Atlas, you can sack 80% of your workforce and focus on raising more money from your community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back when I discovered Star Atlas was a dreaming game, I realised it wasn‚Äôt good for investors, but might be ‚Äúsomething worthwhile on its own terms‚Äù. It seems to me that a darker picture is emerging. I said when I listened to Wagner during the town hall that I had a peculiar feeling: that feeling was a desire to believe what he was saying, an impulse to be reassured. That for me is a warning. ‚ÄúA very positive call‚Äù? No, I don‚Äôt think so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paradoxical thing about a dreaming game is that for it to work, you have to believe there is a real game coming at some point. For anyone paying attention to Star Atlas, it‚Äôs clear that is no longer the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Enjoy our reporting?&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://polemos.io/sign-up-for-the-polemos-newsletter/\"><em>Sign up for the Pharos newsletter</em></a><em>&nbsp;and receive an update every week for free.</em></p>\n",

The team had already been cut from a height of 235 in 2022, meaning 190 staff will have been sacked in the space of less than a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a 6-page letter to his team and the Star Atlas community, Wagner said the cutbacks were necessary after two big capital raising opportunities fell through earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wagner also listed the loss of $15m from the FTX collapse, a tax bill of $30m, and a reduction in value of the ATLAS token as reasons for the financial crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What remains?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>He said the remaining team members would focus on building the SAGE game and the ‚Äúmobile crew companion app‚Äù. SAGE (‚ÄúStar Atlas Golden Era‚Äù) is a browser-based strategy game. The phone-based Companion app &#8211; announced less than a week ago &#8211; combines physical activity and blockchain play-to-earn mechanics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither game has been the core focus of Star Atlas marketing to date, which has centred on the Unreal Engine 5 <a href=\"https://polemos.io/star-atlas-showroom-2-1-massive-ships-and-pretty-skins/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"252611\">MMORPG</a> under development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em>Enjoy our reporting?¬†</em><a href=\"https://polemos.io/sign-up-for-the-polemos-newsletter/\"><em>Sign up for the Pharos newsletter</em></a><em>¬†and receive an update every week for free.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúEven with a reduced scope and delayed timeline on our Unreal Engine product line, we believe it still has immense potential,‚Äù wrote Wagner in the letter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúWhile the team size is much smaller, we will be more agile and fully capable of delivering on our prioritized products and maintaining all other existing products.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lean times</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wagner said the company was reducing all costs where possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúTo demonstrate our commitment to the team and to being in this together, each of the founders will be reducing their fixed compensation by a material amount.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wagner personally would be taking ‚Äúthe minimum salary necessary to maintain exemption (no hourly tracking) compliance under existing labor laws.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under federal US law, if an employee makes less than $47,476 their hours must be tracked.

    "encoded_content": "\n<p>‚ÄúIn the height of the 2021 bull run, the industry was openly promoting pay-to-win mechanics. And if anybody who‚Äôs been paying attention to gaming anytime in the last 10 to 15 years knows that pay-to-win sucks. It‚Äôs no fun to play against somebody who spent $1000 on something and can kill you in one shot.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The quote above, from <strong>Jerry Singer</strong> of mech shooter game <a href=\"https://polemos.io/metalcore-could-be-faction-fight-heaven/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"252045\">Metalcore</a>, goes to the heart of one of blockchain gaming‚Äôs biggest conundrums.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem hinges on the difference between what the blockchain allows you to do, and what it is wise to do if you are trying to make a fun game.¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the people I have interviewed for Polemos, almost all agree that allowing players to gain a big advantage by spending money wrecks games. It‚Äôs easy to grasp why. Most competitive games use artificial constraints that ‚Äúlevel the field‚Äù in transparent ways, and usually, facilitate a contest whose outcome is unknown. Paying to gain advantage reduces transparency and uncertainty of outcome, and therefore fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you flip it around and look at it from the developer‚Äôs perspective, rather than the player‚Äôs, you can see how this becomes a design problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain tech allows players to really own in-game assets, and to trade them outside the game environment. That‚Äôs a revenue and engagement opportunity for developers, but there‚Äôs a snag: if the assets have ‚Äúgame power‚Äù then regardless of how they were initially earned, you end up with every trade eroding game fun. Yes, the trading might be fun in itself, but that‚Äôs a niche pastime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some developers solve the problem by quarantining the blockchain from gameplay. Extraction shooter Shrapnel, <a href=\"https://polemos.io/new-shrapnel-map-to-mix-blossom-and-blood/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"252521\">for example</a>, only allows cosmetic NFTs, and will use the blockchain to facilitate payments to map makers. Collectible card MOBA Wildcard, which has been built as a spectator sport, says the blockchain ‚Äúwill create an actual connection between content creators and their fans‚Äù. There will be no <a href=\"https://polemos.io/the-bettners-on-making-wildcard-a-game-with-a-shot-at-glory/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"252170\">paying for stuff</a> that helps you in the arena.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a growing tendency for studios to move away from describing their new projects as&nbsp; ‚Äúblockchain games‚Äù or ‚Äúweb3 games‚Äù. This makes sense as a response to mainstream gamer hostility to NFTs, but I believe awareness of the pay-to-win conundrum is also feeding into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain integrations are just one part of what makes a game good, rather than the defining factor. As <a href=\"https://polemos.io/sam-peurifoy-on-making-blockchain-games-for-normal-people/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"250721\">Sam Peurifoy</a> once said to me, referring to the protocol at the heart of the internet, we don‚Äôt talk about TCP/IP games, so why talk about blockchain games?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In the World Of Warcraft closet</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/210723_jerry_singer-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-252888\" srcset=\"https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/210723_jerry_singer-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/210723_jerry_singer-300x169.jpg 300w, https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/210723_jerry_singer-768x432.jpg 768w, https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/210723_jerry_singer.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The quote above was taken from my <a href=\"https://polemos.io/jerry-singer-on-metalcore-and-firefighting/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"252887\">Key Characters interview this week</a>. Here‚Äôs another snippet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hal: Games are getting bigger. They&#8217;re four times the size of Hollywood as an industry, and just now we&#8217;re seeing a mainstream awareness and commercial adoption of games. Do you think this is surprising?&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jerry: I think it&#8217;s surprising it took this long. When I think of just my lifetime ‚Ä¶ I&#8217;m 30, and when I was in high school, I didn&#8217;t really tell people I played World Of Warcraft. I was an athlete ‚Ä¶ I was this kid that was playing baseball and I went on to play sports in college. The stigma at the time, this was only 15 or so years ago ‚Ä¶ it was still something that wasn&#8217;t as accepted as it is today.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And it always didn&#8217;t make sense to me ‚Ä¶ now you&#8217;re seeing some companies completely blow that out of the water, building TV shows like Arcane, right? And I think a lot of people don&#8217;t even realize that when you&#8217;re watching Arcane, you&#8217;re immersing yourself in the story of one of the biggest games that exists ‚Ä¶ League of Legends.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story of how Jerry got into crypto, and from there to the Metalcore team, was surprising and the conversation got deeper than I expected. I recommend you <a href=\"https://polemos.io/jerry-singer-on-metalcore-and-firefighting/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"252887\">have a listen</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Blizzard, Battle.net and the curse of exclusivity</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/200723_overwatch-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-252880\" srcset=\"https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/200723_overwatch-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/200723_overwatch-300x169.jpg 300w, https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/200723_overwatch-768x431.jpg 768w, https://polemos.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/200723_overwatch.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how big you are, it&#8217;s hard to make an exclusive platform work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blizzard this week announced it was launching one of its hit games, Overwatch 2, on Valve‚Äôs Steam platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a big deal because Blizzard, makers of World Of Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo, launched their own exclusive game platform, Battle.net, way back in 1996. As an in-house gaming platform it was unprecedented, pre-dating Steam (which began as an exclusive platform but opened up to other games in 2005). Battle.net stuck to its exclusive strategy and relies on Blizzard‚Äôs own games along with Activision titles like Call Of Duty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence the significance of breaking with exclusivity and providing Overwatch on Steam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The situation seems somewhat analogous to the video streaming wars and the launch of big exclusive platforms like Disney+. The jury is still out on Disney+, but it‚Äôs clear time favours the Steams of this world. More content and less reliance on the quality of your own product. <a href=\"https://polemos.io/end-of-an-era-as-blizzards-overwatch-2-goes-up-on-steam/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"252879\">Read</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A decade of Call Of Duty</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One factor feeding into Blizzard&#8217;s decision to put Overwatch 2 on Steam could be the need to appear nice in the midst of parent company Activision Blizzard&#8217;s attempt to merge with Microsoft. You&#8217;ve heard about this before, it&#8217;s the biggest deal ever in games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The merger is almost certainly going ahead now: on Monday Sony (the main whiner) and Microsoft signed a deal to keep the blockbuster Call Of Duty games on Playstation for the next 10 years. US competition watchdog the FTC has lost its chief witness (and Sony was always a terrible witness). <a href=\"https://polemos.io/sony-microsoft-battle-over-call-of-duty-ends/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"252861\">Read</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This is the online version of our <a href=\"https://polemos.io/subscribe-to-the-pharos-newsletter/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"249661\">free weekly newsletter</a>.

The owner of the digital asset that an NFT purports to represent does not necessarily have intellectual property rights for the NFT. This proves the blockchain record&#8217;s ownership.</p>\n<p>NFT cannot be bought or exchanged for equivalent amounts like cryptocurrencies. These attributes contrast with fungible tokens like bitcoins. Bitcoins are interchangeable and may be used as a medium for business transactions because they are identical. An example of an NFT is <a href=\"https://boredapeyachtclub.com/\">Bored Ape Yacht</a>.

This token allows them to exchange their collectibles with other gamers. Additionally, they can swap and integrate their non-fungible entities within the game. As fun as it is, there are rules guiding it, which developers create in the form of smart contracts. NFT games are any form of a web-based gaming platform incorporating NFT directly or indirectly. Examples of NFT games are Axie infinity,¬† Gods Unchained, Game, The Sandbox, and <a href=\"https://www.playtoearn.online/games/splinterlands/#:~:text=Splinterlands%20is%20an%20auto-battler%20card%20game%20where%20every,earn%20card%20and%20token%20rewards%20just%20by%20playing.\"><u>Splinterlands</u></a>.

A laptop and pc are the best when onboarding a user&#8217;s experience.

When it comes to controlling your NFT characters, laptops and PCs provide solutions to that, thanks to the mouse&#8217;s and the keys&#8217; smooth motion.

It is good to know that most NFT games use dimensions such as 640px by 860px or 1080 px as their preferred resolution. Since the details and clarity of a game on a device depend solely on the number of pixels available, it becomes necessary to know that the higher the screen resolution, the higher the pixel will be available to give you the best gaming experience. Hence, gamers should go after devices with high screen resolutions. Below are suitable options for screen resolutions that can give you the best gaming experience ever:</p>\n<p><strong>For Androids:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Resolution 1440 x 3200 pixels (511 PPI density).</li>\n<li>Resolution 1344 x 2772 pixels (456 PPI density).</li>\n<li>Resolution 1080 x 2340 pixels (386 PPI density).</li>\n<li>Resolution 1440 x 3088 pixels (496 PPI density).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>For Computers:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Resolution 1920 x 1080 ‚Äî FHD (Full HD) / 1080p</li>\n<li>Resolution 2560 x 1440 ‚Äî QHD (Quad HD) / 2K 1440p</li>\n<li>Resolution 3840 x 2160 ‚Äî UHD (Ultra HD) / 4K 2160p</li>\n<li>Resolution 7680 √ó 4320 ‚Äî FUHD (Full Ultra HD) / 8K 4320p.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>PHONE PROCESSOR (RAM)</strong></h3>\n<p>Another critical feature of a suitable gaming device is the size of the storage processor. Device processors, also known as the chipset, function like the brain in the human system. It is responsible for the coordination of all the processes going on in a computer system. It is the central hub of a device. The processor receives and executes every command while performing billions of calculations in a mili-second. Most phones with low processing memory tend to lag on usage. Appropriate devices for NFT gaming should have a minimum RAM of 8 GB with 1 GB of free disk space to install the game.</p>\n<h3><strong>BATTERY CAPACITY AND CHARGING SPEED.</strong></h3>\n<p>The rate at which you use your device for gaming is directly proportional to the power that would be drained out. Hence, it becomes an excellent idea to seek after machines with good battery capacity for gaming. It is good to note also that factors like a higher screen resolution and refresh rate contribute to the rate at which a battery gets drained. If you are playing NFT games with your phone, do ensure that your phone has at least a 4,500mAh battery capacity to provide a decent battery life that supports gaming for longer hours.</p>\n<h3><strong>HIGHER REFRESH RATE</strong></h3>\n<p>A higher refresh rate display would induce and allow all the actions and processes on the screen to appear smoother and less hard to follow. This is possible by redrawing the image more times per mili-second. Most gaming devices have these features inbuilt into them. Refresh rates can be as high as 120Hz or 144Hz, or even higher. For Androids, the following instruments ranked best in 2022 concerning their refreshing rate.</p>\n<h3><strong>DEVICE COOLING RATE</strong></h3>\n<p>If your phone is going to be running games concurrently, it is bound to get hot, and thus, it will require an excellent cooling system to disallow the heat from affecting the performance of your device&#8217;s processor. Most devices would naturally get hot during the prolonged usage period. So, It becomes essential that a device be embedded with an appropriate cooling system to control the heat and prevent the processor from being damaged. This process is called throttling, and most gamers tend to avoid this because of its adverse impacts on gaming devices.</p>\n<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>\n<p>Gaming is fun and exciting, but it can also be frustrating. If not carried out on an enabling and supporting device, it will surely be frustrating and might even disinterest the gamers. This gives rise to the quest for the best devices on which NFT games can be played and enjoyed. Before selecting any of your desired devices, one thing to consider is the cost of the device.</p>\n<p>Aside from price, screen resolution, device professor, battery capacity and charging speed, higher refresh rate, and device cooling rate must also be considered. <a href=\"https://www.phonearena.com/news/Phones-fast-charging-speeds-comparison_id125026\"><u>Charging speed</u></a>, higher refresh rate, and device cooling rate must also be regarded. This will enhance your <a href=\"https://excellencexl.com/how-confidence-affects-performance/\"><u>in-game performance,</u></a> including concentration. You won‚Äôt have to panic about your phone overheating or shutting down while playing any NFT game.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/what-devices-can-you-use-to-play-nft-games/\">FAQs: What Devices can You Use to play NFT Games?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com\">PlayToEarnDiary</a>.</p>\n",

This move is particularly beneficial for those who are more familiar with the <a href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/ethereum-interoperability-portal-collaboration-gala-games-joins-forces-with-upland/\">Ethereum ecosystem</a> and <a href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/which-crypto-wallet-is-best-for-p2e-gaming/\">wallets like MetaMask</a>, simplifying their interactions with the Aurory platform.</p>\n<p>Aurory&#8217;s strategy does not involve shifting token holders from one blockchain to another, clarified by Michael Natoli, the Head of Marketing and Business Development. Instead, the objective is to establish fresh entry points into the game and attract participation from various cryptocurrency communities, leveraging their liquidity. This move is intended to expand the Aurory experience into Arbitrum&#8217;s specialized <a href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/web-3-games-the-biggest-drivers/\">Web3 ecosystem.</a></p>\n<p>The proposed &#8220;on-ramps&#8221; will allow players to bring their Aurory NFTs and USDC stablecoins into the game using either blockchain. Once inside, USDC can be exchanged for the game&#8217;s native AURY token.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We&#39;re excited to see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AuroryProject?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AuroryProject</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Arbitrum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Arbitrum</a>!</p>\n<p>Interoperable gaming experiences for all!  <a href=\"https://t.co/akFbw4UNNT\">https://t.co/akFbw4UNNT</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Arbitrum (<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f499.png\" alt=\"üíô\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />,<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9e1.png\" alt=\"üß°\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />) (@arbitrum) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1683943509047357443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 25, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async data-type=\"lazy\" data-src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<h2>Future Plans</h2>\n<p>Aurory&#8217;s expansion is laying the groundwork for future growth.

Google Play and the Apple App Store, two significant players in the mobile app market, have adopted distinct strategies regarding NFTs and <a href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/fun-over-money-what-crypto/\">crypto gaming.</a> This article will look at the policies of these platforms, the impact on game developers, and the ever-changing landscape of NFTs in the world of mobile gaming.</p>\n<h2><strong>Google Play Updates</strong></h2>\n<p>In a recent blog post, Google Play made an announcement regarding its revised policy, granting video game publishers the ability to offer NFT games for sale on their platform. According to Google, this policy update includes a requirement for apps to be upfront with users about <a href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/how-to-create-assets-for-decentraland/\">tokenized digital assets</a>. This move demonstrates Google&#8217;s openness to exploring novel methods of facilitating transactions involving blockchain-based digital content within apps and games.</p>\n<p>Developers are obligated to disclose the inclusion of NFTs in their games and maintain clear and open communication with users about tokenized assets, as mandated by Google&#8217;s policy. The policy explicitly prohibits promoting potential earnings from gaming or merchandising activities and also restricts the sale of loot boxes or <a href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/sorare-adapts-gaming-offer-to-french-gambling-rules/\">gambling mechanics</a> within the games.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-22340\" title=\"Google Play\" src=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Google Play\" width=\"831\" height=\"468\" srcset=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-300x169.jpg 300w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-768x432.jpg 768w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-150x84.jpg 150w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-450x253.jpg 450w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play.jpg 1706w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 831px) 100vw, 831px\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Blockchain Gaming on Andro</strong><strong>id</strong></h2>\n<p>Google Play&#8217;s embrace of NFTs and blockchain games represents a notable chance for <a href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/investors-continue-to-show-a-preference-for-web3-gaming-developers/\">game developers</a> using the Android platform. The acceptance of tokenized assets aims to enrich user experiences and encourages the transformation of conventional games through user-owned content.</p>\n<p>Google Play&#8217;s goal is to cultivate user loyalty by fostering an environment that supports these innovations. Their collaboration with <a href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/immutable-and-polygon-labs-join-forces-to-revolutionize-web3-gaming/\">Web3 gaming</a> pioneers and their efforts to comprehend developers&#8217; obstacles and possibilities underscore Google&#8217;s dedication to the dynamic realm of blockchain gaming.</p>\n<p>According to one of Google&#8217;s regulations, NFTs purchased by users should be utilized within the game to enhance their experience or assist them in progressing further. The usage of NFTs for gambling or <a href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/p2e-hit-calvaria-introduces-staking/\">staking,</a> in exchange for the chance to win real-world monetary prizes (including other NFTs) is strictly prohibited.</p>\n<p>Google is pursuing a careful strategy by teaming up with specific game developers to experiment with and enhance the user experience of <a href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/the-global-blockchain-gaming-market-is-projected-to-grow-1/\">blockchain games</a>. By forming partnerships with notable industry participants such as <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191120005481/en/Mythical-Games-Raises-Additional-19-Million-Bringing-Total-Funding-to-35-Million-as-Studio-Expands-Development-of-Tech-Platform-First-Game-for-Launch\">Mythical Games</a> and Reddit, Google displays its dedication to establishing a fair environment that fosters user confidence and responsible utilization of blockchain technology. Through an iterative development process, Google aims to shape policies that cater to the evolving requirements of developers and the mobile gaming community.</p>\n<h2><strong>Apple is More Restrictive</strong></h2>\n<p>Unlike Google Play, the Apple App Store has historically adopted a more stringent stance towards NFTs and crypto gaming. Although developers are permitted to integrate NFTs into iOS games and apps, Apple continues to enforce its standard 30% commission on transactions involving NFTs. This commission system presents difficulties for developers, as they must adjust NFT prices to account for Apple&#8217;s fees, which could potentially result in higher costs for users.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>The contrasting approaches of Google Play and the Apple App Store mirror a broader split within the mobile gaming industry concerning NFTs and crypto integration. Google Play is open to the possibilities of NFTs and blockchain gaming, whereas Apple takes a more cautious approach, prioritizing the retention of its commission structure and responsible implementation. As a result of this divide, developers and users will encounter distinct experiences when operating on the two platforms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/google-play-stores-latest-announcement-games-and-apps-can-now-include-nfts/\">Google Play Store&#8217;s Latest Announcement: Games and Apps Can Now Include NFTs</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com\">PlayToEarnDiary</a>.</p>\n",

In order to achieve such a high level of compatibility, game developers will need to collaborate in the creation of shared universes and cross-platform experiences.</p>\n<p>Back in 2020, Tim Sweeney, the CEO of <a href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/gods-unchained-now-available-on-the-epic-games-store/\">Epic Games</a>, the company behind the <a href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/nike-and-fortnite-generate-buzz-with-potential-nft-collaboration/\">Fortnite gaming universe</a>, shared his vision of gaming within the metaverse. He envisioned a shift away from isolated ecosystems towards a more open environment, gradually resembling an inclusive metaverse by the end of the current decade.</p>\n<p>In this envisioned metaverse, players would gather with their friends and seamlessly transition between different game experiences while staying connected as a group, irrespective of the platforms they are using. This would eliminate concerns about the device manufacturer or the server operator, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in these collective experiences.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_19400\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19400\" style=\"width: 774px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-19400\" title=\"\" src=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"774\" height=\"436\" srcset=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1-300x169.png 300w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1-1024x577.png 1024w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1-768x433.png 768w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1-150x85.png 150w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1-450x254.png 450w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1-1200x676.png 1200w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1.png 1260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-19400\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credit: The Coin Republic.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Decentralizing Gaming Using Web3</h2>\n<p>Web3 technology, which harnesses the potential of blockchain and decentralized protocols, is on the brink of transforming the gaming industry by granting players genuine digital ownership and authority over their <a href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/the-mmo-nft-game-farsite-create-your-own-in-game-assets/\">in-game assets</a>. Although the ability to purchase in-game assets already exists in numerous games, these items are typically associated with specific games rather than individual players or avatars.</p>\n<p>However, in the future internet, gamers will have the ability to engage in trading, selling, or transferring their digital items as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) across diverse platforms, facilitated by web3 technologies.

P2E games offer rewards to players for tasks completion, battling other players, or progressing through various levels.</p>\n<p>These rewards typically come in the form of in-game tokens or assets represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can be traded, sold, or exchanged for real-world value. This innovative approach is disrupting traditional gaming business models, enhancing the rewards of gameplay, and incentivizing active player engagement.</p>\n<p>P2E models have the potential to democratize gaming by providing earning opportunities for players, particularly in regions where access to conventional financial systems is limited. An example of a prominent P2E game utilizing blockchain technology is <a href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/exciting-updates-on-axie-infinity/\">Axie Infinity.</a></p>\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>There is no denying the exhilarating prospects that lie ahead for the gaming industry, driven by the transformative forces of the metaverse and web3 technologies. These advancements are set to introduce a fresh era of interconnected and immersive experiences. As the gaming landscape undergoes profound changes, we can anticipate the emergence of a more diverse and inclusive industry that presents vast opportunities for both players and developers alike.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com/tech-trends-changing-the-gaming-landscape/\">Tech Trends Changing the Gaming Landscape</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://playtoearndiary.com\">PlayToEarnDiary</a>.</p>\n",

Brace yourselves for the next-level brilliance ‚Äì drum roll, please ‚Äì the one, the only, the mind-blowing concept of &#8220;Do-it-to-Earn&#8221;! Yes, you heard it right, now you can earn crypto just by doing stuff. Is this some kind of virtual dream? Nope, it&#8217;s real, and it&#8217;s here to rock your world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what is this &#8220;Do-it-to-Earn&#8221; sorcery? Well, it&#8217;s all in the name, my dear friends. You do stuff, and voil√†! Crypto starts raining down on you like confetti at a crypto party. And guess what? These activities can be as random as a toddler&#8217;s doodle. Play games, run like your life depends on it (well, maybe your crypto wallet&#8217;s life), and even learn stuff ‚Äì yep, education pays now!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the non-techies out there, this whole Do-it-to-Earn jazz might sound as perplexing as trying to explain quantum physics to a houseplant. Fear not, for we&#8217;ve got you covered with a blog tailored just for you! We&#8217;ll unravel the secrets of the various Do-it-to-Earn types and show you how to swim in the crypto-rich waters without drowning in confusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-birth-of-gamefi-and-p2e\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Birth of GameFi and P2E</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The genius idea of GameFi (yep, it&#8217;s a thing now) came to life when gaming met cryptocurrencies, and they hit it off like a match made in the blockchain heaven. That&#8217;s when Play-to-Earn, or P2E for the cool kids, strutted onto the scene. Picture this: you play games, and in return, you get rewarded with digital goodies like NFTs (fancy collectibles) or cryptocurrencies. It&#8217;s like getting paid for having a blast ‚Äì sign me up!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these P2E games, you&#8217;ll find all sorts of treats. Some have in-game tokens, think of them as the golden coins of the digital realm, like AXS and SLP in the ever-popular Axie Infinity. And that&#8217;s not all, it gets even better ‚Äì there are Pok√©mon-inspired creatures (NFTs, to be exact) to add to your collection. It&#8217;s like your wildest childhood dreams coming true, but with crypto sprinkled on top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These P2E games aren&#8217;t just some fly-by-night scheme. They are all about creating sustainable economies, balancing the value of their precious NFTs and in-game tokens like a master chef balancing flavors in a five-star restaurant. So, buckle up, my fellow gamers, because this is just the beginning of the P2E adventure, and we&#8217;re in for a wild, profitable ride!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-play-to-earn-games\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are Play-to-Earn Games?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>P2E games love to spoil their players with NFTs or cryptocurrencies as rewards, and guess what? You can trade these digital treasures for other valuable assets or even convert them into good ol&#8217; fiat currencies through exchanges and marketplaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before you dive headfirst into this money-making extravaganza, get your wallets ready. Yep, these games demand an upfront investment, and it can be quite the chunk of change depending on factors like the token&#8217;s value and how badly folks want in. For example, during the AXS token peak, new players had to cough up around $1,000 just to join the party!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"is-there-a-game-that-pays-real-money\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is there a game that pays real money?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, here comes the big question ‚Äì can you find a game that dishes out real, tangible money? Well, well, well, plenty of P2E games are generous enough to shower you with rewards in the form of cryptocurrencies or NFTs, which you can happily convert into fiat currencies. But, and there&#8217;s a &#8220;but,&#8221; no blockchain-based game is going to hand you actual fiat on a virtual platter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why, you ask? Simple. Paying in fiat currency would spoil the party for the in-game token, and we can&#8217;t have that. The token is the lifeblood of the game&#8217;s economy, ensuring things stay sustainable and exciting. So, while the game won&#8217;t stuff your pockets with paper bills, rest assured you&#8217;ll be swimming in a sea of crypto-riches!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-play-to-earn-nft-games\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are Play-to-Earn NFT games?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Play-to-earn NFT games are a fascinating gaming trend that introduces a new way for players to engage and potentially earn money. In these games, participants begin by purchasing an NFT, which could be a weapon, character, or avatar, as a ticket to enter the virtual world. Just like other play-to-earn games, players can make profits from their gaming efforts. However, the rewards are often distributed in the form of NFTs, which require players to utilize a marketplace to convert them into cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"examples-of-play-to-earn-games\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Examples of Play-to-Earn games</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The play-to-earn model, initially popularized by Axie Infinity, has given rise to numerous blockchain-based games incorporating this unique framework. Among the top five games following this approach are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Axie Infinity: </strong>In this game, players collect and create NFTs representing adorable axolotl-inspired digital pets called Axies.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Decentraland: </strong>This NFT-centric blockchain game allows players to construct their own virtual environments, explore other users&#8217; habitats, and participate in various activities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Gods Unchained: </strong>Offering a free-to-play experience, this competitive trading card game employs NFTs to enhance card ownership and value.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Splinterlands: </strong>Another captivating <a href=\"https://nftandgamefi.com/2022/06/23/slinterlands-play2earn-launches-gaming-channel/\">blockchain-based trading card game</a> where players can trade, strategize, and compete to earn valuable NFTs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The Sandbox: </strong>Within this virtual world, players can unleash their creativity by building, owning, and monetizing their unique gaming experiences, all based on NFT ownership.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Read also: <a href=\"https://nftandgamefi.com/2023/07/03/nft-games-list/\">Best NFT games to Play in 2023</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-move-to-earn-games\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are Move-to-Earn Games?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Move-to-earn games represent an innovative fusion of the fitness and cryptocurrency industries, where players are incentivized to engage in physical activities such as working out, walking, and running to earn cryptocurrency rewards. These games leverage technology to track the movement of players and distribute crypto rewards accordingly. However, to prevent excessive exploitation, the rewards are usually capped on a daily basis, encouraging participants to maintain their regular fitness routines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One exciting aspect of move-to-earn games is the incorporation of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in the form of sports accessories like sneakers. To participate in these games, players are required to acquire at least one of these NFTs, which adds a unique and collectible element to the experience.

As a reward for their learning efforts, users receive payouts in the form of the underlying cryptocurrency, encouraging them to explore and engage with it firsthand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The premise behind learn-to-earn games is to educate users about the intricacies of various cryptocurrencies while providing them with a practical experience of using these digital assets. By combining education and cryptocurrency incentives, these games offer a valuable opportunity for individuals to expand their knowledge of the crypto space while also gaining a tangible stake in the currencies they learn about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"where-can-i-learn-to-earn-crypto\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I learn to earn crypto?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://letmespeak.org/\">LetMeSpeak</a>: </strong>Earn while you learn English!

Afterward, they complete quizzes to test their knowledge and understanding. Upon successfully completing the quizzes, users receive crypto rewards directly deposited into their Coinbase account. The rewards may not make users wealthy, but it&#8217;s a convenient and relatively low-time investment to learn and earn in the crypto space.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://academy.binance.com/en/learn-and-earn\"><strong>Binance Learn</strong></a> is available exclusively to users who already have a Binance account. This aspect serves as a perk or reward for being a Binance account holder. Similar to Coinbase Earn, users watch videos and take quizzes to enhance their understanding of different cryptocurrencies. However, the reward system differs slightly. Instead of receiving the crypto tokens directly, users are issued vouchers for the respective cryptocurrencies they have learned about. It&#8217;s important to note that these vouchers have a limited validity period of 14 days, prompting users to take action and redeem their earned rewards within the given timeframe.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Phemex</strong>, a centralized exchange, previously <a href=\"https://phemex.com/learn-crypto\">introduced a learn-to-earn feature</a>, allowing users to earn rewards while expanding their cryptocurrency knowledge. However, as of the current moment, the platform has announced the temporary suspension of the reward element due to a restructuring of its bonus program. This serves as a reminder that rewards programs, despite their appeal, can be subject to changes or even temporary suspension when companies need to make adjustments in response to various factors. Flexibility and awareness are essential in navigating the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrency exchanges and their associated incentives.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gate.io/learn\"><strong>Gate Learn</strong> presents</a> a remarkable opportunity for skilled creators to capitalize on their knowledge and expertise while earning cryptocurrency rewards. By submitting engaging, informative, and original articles on a topic of their choice, users stand a chance to receive up to 150 USDT per article. The process is simple and involves crafting compelling content, which is then reviewed by the Gate.io team. The submitted content is assessed based on various criteria, including accuracy and creativity. Higher-ranked articles have a greater likelihood of being published and subsequently rewarded with higher incentives. Gate Learn&#8217;s platform thus serves as a platform that values and rewards knowledge-sharing, empowering creators to contribute to the community while earning crypto for their valuable insights and contributions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nexus</strong>¬†is a¬†<a href=\"https://chaindebrief.com/nexus/\">Learn and Earn¬†program by Chain Debrief</a> that enables users to receive tokens while¬†learning¬†about a cryptocurrency project</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"4970\" data-permalink=\"https://nftandgamefi.com/2023/08/05/do-it-to-earn-crypto/image-1-10/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nftandgamefi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1.png?fit=1280%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,720\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nftandgamefi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1.png?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nftandgamefi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nftandgamefi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4970\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"do-to-earn-games-forecasts\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do-to-Earn games forecasts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The future of Do-It-To-Earn blockchain apps looks extremely promising, as this incentive-driven model continues to find its way into various industries. Already successfully implemented in gaming, fitness, and learning, it holds the potential to expand into new sectors such as entertainment, food, and health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, integrating the Do-It-To-Earn model with the entertainment industry could offer users rewards for watching movies and series, creating an engaging and interactive experience for viewers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key strengths of this model is its ability to reward users for everyday activities, making it appealing to a broad audience. Activities like playing games, exercising, and learning are not only incentivized, but they are also enjoyable, further increasing their appeal to a wide user base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, there is an exciting opportunity to explore the integration of Do-It-To-Earn apps with the metaverse, a virtual shared space where users can interact, create, and participate in various experiences. This integration could open up new dimensions for engagement and rewards within the virtual world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, the future of Do-It-To-Earn blockchain apps holds immense potential for growth, innovation, and widespread adoption across multiple industries, making it an exciting trend to watch as it continues to shape the digital landscape.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nftandgamefi.com/2023/08/05/do-it-to-earn-crypto/\">Do-it-to-Earn: the new era in crypto gaming</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nftandgamefi.com\">NFTandGameFi</a>.</p>\n",

We will dive into the digital madness and see who&#8217;s going to rock the metaverse. This July, the heat isn&#8217;t just rising in the atmosphere; it&#8217;s also soaring in the realm of blockchain gaming. So, let&#8217;s have a closer look at what the gaming industry has prepared for us this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"1-affyn-the-rising-star-of-play-to-earn\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Affyn: The Rising Star of Play-to-Earn</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, we have <a href=\"https://nftandgamefi.com/2023/06/20/affyn-game-review/\">Affyn play-to-earn (P2E)</a> game that&#8217;s so ambitious, it might have bitten off more than it can chew. This P2E prodigy is set to give Pok√©mon GO a run for its money with its geolocation-based gameplay. You don&#8217;t just play Affyn, you live it, as they proudly claim. The team seems to have a thing for being real, as their native token, $FYN, isn&#8217;t just confined to the digital world but can be used to purchase real-world goods and services. That&#8217;s right, you can grab your morning latte with your gaming tokens. How&#8217;s that for a game-changer?</p>\n\n\n\n<script async src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-7389952621846029\"\n     crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"\n     \n     data-ad-layout=\"in-article\"\n     data-ad-format=\"fluid\"\n     data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7389952621846029\"\n     data-ad-slot=\"2695566356\"></ins>\n<script>\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script>\n\n\n\n<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more. Despite a few high-profile departures, the Affyn team is exuding an air of confidence that&#8217;s contagious. They&#8217;re committed to a free-to-play model and are boldly tackling sustainability issues prevalent in the P2E genre. So, with grand plans for mainstream adoption and a unique approach to sustainability, Affyn could be the next P2E sensation. Or it could be an overhyped dud. Only time will tell‚Äã.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2-vulcanverse-the-greco-roman-metaverse\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">2.

Featuring world-building and quests, player-owned lands, and NFT-based game assets, VulcanVerse is all set to give Julius Caesar a complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"4591\" data-permalink=\"https://nftandgamefi.com/2023/07/03/nft-games-list/vulcanverse/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nftandgamefi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vulcanverse.png?fit=1172%2C702&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1172,702\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"vulcanverse\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nftandgamefi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vulcanverse.png?fit=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nftandgamefi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vulcanverse.png?fit=1024%2C613&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"613\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nftandgamefi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vulcanverse.png?resize=1024%2C613&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4591\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This game&#8217;s got a star team including Fighting Fantasy authors and famous fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. The game is in beta, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped them from inking strategic partnerships with the likes of AAG Ventures, Animoca Brands, and MetaRing. But like any good Greek tragedy, there&#8217;s a twist. VulcanVerse is grappling with technical issues, player adoption, and regulatory uncertainty. Will VulcanVerse rise like a phoenix or go down like the Titanic? Stay tuned!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-derby-stars-the-dark-horse-of-nft-gaming\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Derby Stars: The Dark Horse of NFT Gaming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching gears from the ancient world to the racetrack, <a href=\"https://nftandgamefi.com/2023/06/12/derby-starts-review/\">Derby Stars</a> is an upcoming play-to-earn horse racing game that&#8217;s hoping to win the Triple Crown of the NFT metaverse. Developed on the Polygon blockchain, this game gives players the chance to own, breed, and race NFT horses, which has all the thrills of owning a real horse without the mess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not all sunshine and roses. Derby Stars is still in the early stages of development and has to navigate potential technical issues and regulatory changes. Will Derby Stars be the Secretariat of the NFT gaming world, or will it end up as an also-ran?

    "link": "https://nftandgamefi.com/2022/12/17/gamefi-reward-gamers-with-bitcoin/",
    "pub_date": "Sat, 17 Dec 2022 14:19:25 +0000",
    "encoded_content": "<figure><img src=\"https://nftandgamefi.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/shutterstock_2142377323-min.jpeg\" class=\"type:primaryImage\" /></figure>\n<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that <a href=\"https://nftandgamefi.com/2022/02/05/understanding-nfts-everything-you-need-to-know-before-buying/\">Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are</a> all the rage right now. Many people see them as a way to revolutionize the gaming industry and create new possibilities for player interactions. However, a recent study has shown that gamers are actually more interested in earning Bitcoin than NFTs. Here&#8217;s why&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"is-style-cnvs-list-styled\">\n<li><strong>Reason #1 &#8211; Bitcoin Has More Uses</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike NFTs, Bitcoin has a wide range of uses beyond gaming. It can be used to purchase goods and services, pay bills, etc. This makes it much more versatile than NFTs, which are mainly limited to the gaming world. Bitcoin has a higher probability to be useful as a monetary unit account. This means that earning Bitcoin while gaming has the potential to be more profitable <a href=\"https://nftandgamefi.com/2022/11/22/is-nft-dead/\">than earning NFTs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"is-style-cnvs-list-styled\">\n<li><strong>Reason #2 &#8211; Bitcoin Is More Stable</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason why gamers are more interested in earning Bitcoin than NFTs is that it&#8217;s much more stable. The value of a single Bitcoin today may not be the same tomorrow, but it&#8217;s far more stable than NFTs. The value of an individual NFT can fluctuate wildly in a very short amount of time, making it difficult to predict its worth.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"is-style-cnvs-list-styled\">\n<li><strong>Reason #3 &#8211; Bitcoin Is Easier To Trade</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin is also much easier to trade. It&#8217;s fungible. This means that it can be exchanged for other currencies and goods without any problem. On the other hand, NFTs are non-fungible, meaning each one is unique and can only be exchanged with the same type of NFT. This makes trading them much more difficult than Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"play-to-earn-incentives-gameplay-but-the-reward-has-to-be-desirable\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Play-To-Earn Incentives Gameplay But The Reward Has To Be Desirable</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers from Zeebedee (Fintech Company) discovered that the majority of respondents (67%) are more likely to play free games if they offer crypto rewards. This is likely because being able to earn rewards for being immersed in a game that is enjoyable rather than working at a job is much more desirable. However, the reward itself must be desirable. Each person has their own way of valuing assets, but it‚Äôs clear that Bitcoin is more valuable to gamers <a href=\"https://nftandgamefi.com/2022/02/06/value-of-nfts-how-it-is-formed/\">than NFTs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-attachment-id=\"3309\" data-permalink=\"https://nftandgamefi.com/2022/12/17/gamefi-reward-gamers-with-bitcoin/shutterstock_2181421907-min/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nftandgamefi.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/shutterstock_2181421907-min.jpeg?fit=1000%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,400\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"shutterstock_2181421907-min\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nftandgamefi.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/shutterstock_2181421907-min.jpeg?fit=300%2C120&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nftandgamefi.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/shutterstock_2181421907-min.jpeg?fit=1000%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nftandgamefi.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/shutterstock_2181421907-min.jpeg?resize=1000%2C400&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3309\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In my opinion, this is because Bitcoin simply has more value because it&#8217;s an asset that&#8217;s backed by energy. Proof of work (or hash rate) is required to mine Bitcoin and it&#8217;s much more difficult to come by than simply collecting NFTs. Gaming requires the trade of your work within a game, so earning a digital asset that corresponds to the energy of that work and has real-world value makes a lot of sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"freedom-vs-status-bitcoin-vs-nfts\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Freedom vs Status (Bitcoin vs NFTs)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>27% of gamers would be happy if a game offered Bitcoin as a reward. In contrast, only 5% want NFTs as a reward. One speculation is that NFTs, although each individual one is unique, the creators of the game can create a lot of them, potentially leading to inflation. With Bitcoin, there is a finite amount and its value is based on scarcity rather than arbitrary rules set by a game developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To illustrate why this could be a problem, imagine that you ranked #1 for a gaming season, but the game developers decided to have a new season every 2 weeks rather than every 4 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, it wouldn‚Äôt be worth competing anymore because the rewards are so watered down. This would be like the value of a trophy for a specific competition during a specific time. It has no value beyond the personal recognition of achievement because gamers that buy the NFT would know they didn&#8217;t earn it. This is not an issue with Bitcoin, as it cannot be artificially inflated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin would be like earning prize money and trading that for more time to play and practice rather than work or fund the gamer lifestyle rather than being a status symbol. Although there&#8217;s value in owning status symbols, it seems like more people would opt for the freedom that Bitcoin brings. As sound money can be saved without being devalued due to inflation or manipulated by a central authority, labor can be stored over the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"why-not-offer-both\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Not Offer Both?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the competition, earning trophies is great! But they don&#8217;t create the ability for participants to fully be engaged in the activity. Oftentimes, even the top contenders have to take on side jobs to maintain a living. Prize money helps participants to continue their activity without having to work at jobs they dislike just to continue with this pursuit. BTC can serve this role in digital competitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s the status symbol of being the &#8216;winner&#8217; that motivates many to excel at that activity. It also unlocks experience and opportunities. Those parading a gold medal often gain more sponsorships and collaborations than those who don&#8217;t. They may even have easier access to events and clubs. As mentioned earlier, this can be likened with NFTs in the digital realm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why offering both Bitcoin and NFTs would be an ideal solution. Each one plays a separate role in creating an industry that both satisfies the human need for resources to survive and the status that drives exciting competition. This duo will create interest within a game and growth in <a href=\"https://nftandgamefi.com/2022/05/25/get-started-in-gamefi/\">the entire GameFi economy</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, it&#8217;s clear why gamers are more interested in earning Bitcoin than NFTs. Bitcoin has multiple uses, is more stable, and can be used to fund gaming expenses. NFTs are status symbols, but it is difficult for gamers to earn real-world value from them (beyond influencing sponsorships and other experiences). By offering both Bitcoin and NFTs, game developers can create a system that benefits everyone involved in the gaming industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, many DeFi games are only offering NFTs as a reward. With these new findings, developers may want to consider adding Bitcoin as a reward option for their games. This will create more opportunities for gamers and could help take the entire GameFi industry to the next level.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nftandgamefi.com/2022/12/17/gamefi-reward-gamers-with-bitcoin/\">GameFi Needs To Start Rewarding Players With Bitcoin Rather Than Just NFTs ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nftandgamefi.com\">NFTandGameFi</a>.</p>\n",

    "encoded_content": "<p>Imagine a world where playing video games isn't just about beating high scores or unlocking achievements. A world where every kill, every win, every in-game item you acquire could turn into real money in your pocket. This isn't a fantasy; it's the fascinating world of play-to-earn (P2E) crypto games.</p>\n<p>In these games, players can earn cryptocurrency by participating in the game's ecosystem, which could involve anything from selling in-game items, winning battles, to staking virtual land. These games, usually built on blockchain technology, have disrupted traditional gaming, creating an economy where players can earn from their skills and time.</p>\n<p>But how does it work? How can a virtual game generate real money?</p>\n<p>Well, it's all about blockchain and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These technologies enable the creation of unique digital assets &#8211; think of them like virtual collector's items, but with a twist. Each of these assets can be bought, sold, or traded for real-world value.</p>\n<p>Now that we've laid the groundwork, let's dive into 7 crypto games that let you earn real money in 2023, allowing players to earn while they play.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. League of Kingdoms</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.leagueofkingdoms.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">League of Kingdoms</a></span> is a full-feature MMO Strategy game on the blockchain where you can own, play, and earn rewards by developing your own kingdoms. It's a decentralised and self-sovereign ecosystem shaped by users. This game is available on Android, iOS, and Windows, and it's classified as easy to play. It's free to play but has some paid tiers for those who want to unlock additional features such as custom avatars, chat rooms, and access to premium items.</p>\n<p>In the world of League of Kingdoms, players work together to build and manage a virtual world. Players can construct their kingdom, raise armies, form coalitions, join guilds, battle enemies, and explore the world map. It's possible to purchase land and other NFT assets through the game‚Äôs official marketplace or from other players in the OpenSea marketplace.</p>\n<p>The game has some unique features such as Drago NFTs, dragon-like creatures that are formidable allies of the kingdom and decisive combatants. The in-game currency, $LOKA, is used to power the game, and players can earn LOKA tokens while playing the game‚Äôs quests. These tokens can then be used to purchase various virtual goods like cosmetic items, weapons, armor, pets, mounts, and buildings.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the game also features a play-to-earn mechanism powered by the Dragon Soul Token ($DST), a utility token. The ownership of NFTs allows players to earn cryptocurrencies, with most gaming costs allocated towards rewarding active players and landlords.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Realm</strong></h2>\n<p>Built on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.realm.art/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Realm</a></span> is a play-to-earn metaverse game where players can create and explore user-generated worlds. The game is immersive and offers a unique virtual reality experience, setting it apart from other crypto games. Players can explore realms to discover rare NFTs, earn $REALM tokens, trade with each other, and socialize with others, making it more interactive and engaging.</p>\n<p>With Realm, players aren't just playing a game, they're part of an interactive, digital community. Whether you're building a world, exploring new environments, or meeting new friends, Realm offers a unique, immersive gaming experience that's definitely worth a try.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. Splinterlands</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://splinterlands.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Splinterlands</a></span> is a digital, collectible card game where players build up their collection of cards, each of which is a unique NFT, and battle against others. The game uses blockchain technology to ensure fair play and secure ownership of the digital assets, offering players a new level of gameplay and card ownership. The game is available on both web and mobile platforms, making it accessible to a wide range of players.</p>\n<p>In Splinterlands, players collect, trade, upgrade, and battle with their cards to earn ranking points and climb up the leaderboard. The game also features a real-money economy where players can earn and spend the game's native currency, Dark Energy Crystals (DEC). These can be earned through winning battles and completing quests, and spent on new cards or entering into tournaments.</p>\n<p>Splinterlands uses NFTs (non-fungible tokens) to represent each card in the game, ensuring that each one is unique and owned by a specific player. Players can trade their NFTs with others or sell them on the game‚Äôs official marketplaces, potentially earning significant profits if they have rare or powerful cards.</p>\n<p>Earning potential for Splinterlands players is tied to their strategic ability, gameplay performance, and the time they invest in the game. As players win battles and complete quests, they earn DEC which can then be traded for real-world currencies. The more skilled and active a player is, the more they can potentially earn.</p>\n<h2><strong>4. Tamadoge (TAMA)</strong></h2>\n<p>Step aside Mario, there's a new game in town: <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://tamadoge.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tamadoge</a></span>. Tamadoge is a meme project turned thrilling play-to-earn (P2E) gaming platform that is quickly gaining traction in the crypto gaming world. Its arcade collection kicked off with &#8220;Super Doge,&#8221; a game that takes players on a coin-collecting, SECKnights-battling adventure reminiscent of our beloved plumber. With a leaderboard offering bountiful rewards in TAMA tokens, the game taps into the competitive spirit of players and makes every jump count.</p>\n<p>But Tamadoge is no one-trick pony with plans to develop five arcade games. The platform offers a free-to-play version, making it accessible for players to test the waters before diving into the full P2E game. For that, players need a Doge NFT available on OpenSea, ranging from common to ultra-rare tiers. Each game sets you back just one TAMA token, a small price for the thrill of the game.</p>\n<h2><strong>5. Meta Apes</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://metaapesgame.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta Apes</a></span> is a captivating play-to-earn Web3 game that takes you to a post-apocalyptic era where humans are history, and apes reign supreme. As a player, you control a unique Meta-Ape, each possessing distinctive traits and abilities. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is not just survival, but the dominance of space. Cooperation is key &#8211; you and your ape clan must collaborate to conquer and win the interstellar race.</p>\n<p>Meta Apes cleverly employs a dual token model to enhance gameplay and create an intriguing economic dynamic. SHELL serves as the in-game currency, allowing you to purchase essential resources. However, to truly evolve your ape and establish dominance, you'll need PEEL, the governance token. PEEL can be staked and strategically used to upgrade your Meta-Ape, providing a layer of complexity and strategy to the game.</p>\n<p>Free to play yet rich in strategy, Meta Apes immerses players in a world where apes lead the space race. It's a wild ride that combines post-apocalyptic survival, interspecies governance, and a race to space, creating a unique and engaging play-to-earn gaming experience. With every SHELL spent and PEEL staked, players are drawn deeper into this intriguing, ape-dominated world.</p>\n<h2><strong>6. Crazy Defense Heroes</strong></h2>\n<p>Brace yourself for an adrenaline rush with <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://crazydefenseheroes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crazy Defense Heroes</a></span>, a captivating blend of tower defense and card collection that's sure to hook any strategy game enthusiast. Here, your kingdom is under threat from relentless monster hordes, and it's up to you to fend them off using defensive structures and special abilities. With every battle fought, you collect cards that allow you to fine-tune your defense strategy, making each fight a thrilling blend of action and strategic planning.</p>\n<p>What sets Crazy Defense Heroes apart in the realm of crypto games is the integration of its native utility token, TOWER. This Ethereum-based token is not just a means of acquiring NFTs within the Crazy Kings franchise. It's also your ticket to exclusive events and tournaments, adding an additional layer of excitement to the gameplay.</p>\n<p>Beyond its play-to-earn mechanics, TOWER also plays a crucial role in the governance of the game. As a governance token, it gives players a say in the evolution of the game, reinforcing the sense of community and player engagement. Crazy Defense Heroes successfully blends thrilling gameplay with strategic depth and community engagement, making it a compelling entry in the world of crypto gaming.</p>\n<h2><strong>7. Galaxy Fight Club</strong></h2>\n<p>Get ready for an interstellar showdown with <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://galaxyfightclub.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Galaxy Fight Club (GFC)</a></span>, a thrilling cross-platform PvP MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) where your NFT avatars are the stars of the show. Here, your Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) Apes can go head-to-head with a friend's Cryptopunks in an epic cosmic battle. Played in fast-paced 3v3 battles that last roughly five minutes, the game is an exhilarating mix of strategy and chaos. The goal is simple yet challenging: be the first team to score 20 kills.</p>\n<p>But Galaxy Fight Club is more than just a celestial battleground. It's also a space where your NFT avatars can grow and evolve. The game employs the GCOIN utility token for a range of in-game transactions. Whether you're opening loot boxes won in battle, forging new weapons, or training your fighters to become more formidable, GCOIN is your key to enhancing your gameplay experience.</p>\n<p>Unique to Galaxy Fight Club is that GCOIN tokens are only minted by Genesis Galaxy Fighters. This not only makes them a prized in-game asset but also contributes to their value on secondary markets. Galaxy Fight Club merges the excitement of MOBA gaming with the tangible rewards of play-to-earn mechanisms, all set within a vibrant universe populated by your favorite NFT avatars.</p>\n",

    "pub_date": "Mon, 05 Jun 2023 17:29:05 +0000",
    "encoded_content": "<p>As one of the pioneering play-to-earn blockchain games, Axie Infinity captured the attention of gamers and investors alike, emerging as a game-changer in the gaming industry. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the game provided a source of income for many Filipinos, skyrocketing its popularity.</p>\n<p>However, recent challenges and a decline in market value have raised questions about the future of Axie Infinity. In this article, we will explore the rise of Axie Infinity, analyze the challenges it currently faces, and assess its potential for recovery and future growth.</p>\n<h2><strong>Everything You Need to Know About Axie Infinity</strong></h2>\n<p>Axie Infinity, developed by the Vietnamese-based gaming company Sky Mavis, revolutionized the gaming landscape by introducing play-to-earn mechanics. The game centers around collecting, breeding, battling, and building kingdoms with virtual pets known as Axies. These adorable creatures became digital assets that players could own and trade, attracting a passionate community of players.</p>\n<p>The play-to-earn mechanics of Axie Infinity offered players a unique opportunity to generate income while enjoying the game. By participating in battles and completing in-game tasks, players earned Smooth Love Potion (SLP), an in-game token that could be exchanged for real-world value.</p>\n<p>This concept proved especially appealing to individuals looking for alternative income streams, and the game gained significant traction, particularly in the Philippines.</p>\n<p>The Axie Scholarship program emerged as a popular way for players with limited resources or time to participate in the game. Through this program, experienced players, known as managers, would lend their Axies to others, known as scholars, who would play the game on their behalf. The rewards earned would then be shared between the manager and the scholars, providing a mutually beneficial arrangement.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is Axie Infinity Declining?</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite its initial success, Axie Infinity has faced several challenges, leading to a decline in market performance. Like many altcoins, the game experienced a significant drop in market capitalization, losing over 90% of its value from its peak. This decline can be attributed to the broader market trends affecting cryptocurrencies with investors now turning their attention to artificial intelligence, metaverse, web3 and meme projects.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/tech/axie-infinity-ronin-hack/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Axie Infinity suffered a major setback in March 23, 2022 when it became the target of a high-profile hack</a></span>. Approximately $615 million in cryptocurrency was stolen, primarily from the <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://roninchain.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ronin network</a></span>, the blockchain infrastructure supporting Axie Infinity. The theft, orchestrated by exploiting stolen private keys, resulted in a loss of user confidence and cast a shadow over the game's reputation.</p>\n<p>The immediate aftermath of the hack has seen a significant decrease in the number of daily active users, as players became concerned about the security of their assets, with the numbers currently at around 25000 users from a peak of 2.78 million users during the COVID-19 pandemic. Axie Infinity's reputation took a hit, and rebuilding trust has become a top priority for the developers.</p>\n<h2><strong>Will Axie Infinity Recover?</strong></h2>\n<p>While the path to recovery may be challenging, and Axie Infinity may not return to its pre-pandemic value, the play-to-earn gaming project still possesses potential for revitalization. The game remains an influential player within the play-to-earn gaming sphere, leveraging its passionate community and innovative gameplay mechanics.</p>\n<p>To regain trust and rebuild its user base, Axie Infinity and its developers must prioritize bolstering security measures and enhancing transparency. Implementing stringent security protocols, conducting frequent audits, and fostering open communication with the community are crucial steps to prevent future hacks and restore player confidence.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Axie Infinity team should focus on improving the overall gameplay experience and expanding the features that initially attracted users. Continuous innovation, such as introducing new Axie breeds, refining breeding and battling mechanics, and forging partnerships with other prominent blockchain games, can reignite interest and entice players to return.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Axie Infinity's recovery is intricately tied to the wider adoption of blockchain technology and the acceptance of cryptocurrencies. As the blockchain and crypto industry matures, more individuals and investors will become acquainted with the concept of play-to-earn games, potentially leading to a resurgence of interest in Axie Infinity and similar projects.</p>\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n<p>Axie Infinity's journey from its remarkable rise during the pandemic to its current challenges demonstrates the dynamic nature of the blockchain gaming industry. While the game faces significant hurdles, it still harbours the potential to adapt, recover, and thrive. By addressing security concerns, enhancing gameplay, and capitalizing on the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies, Axie Infinity can navigate the evolving landscape and bounce back.</p>\n",

    "encoded_content": "<p>Horse racing is one of the oldest games in history, and as such, it's important to explore new ways to modernize the game and improve it to meet the standards of the 21st century gaming industry.</p>\n<p>This quest to improve horse racing and the gaming space in general has seen the integration of technological concepts such as virtual reality (VR) to make gaming more interesting and attractive.</p>\n<p>In the midst of the scramble to adapt the horse racing space to emerging technological innovations, Zed Run has taken the bull by the horns by introducing a new way to make players enjoy their horse racing gaming experience.</p>\n<p>So without further ado, let's find out the things that differentiate Zed Run from other horse racing games currently available online.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is Zed Run?</strong></h2>\n<p>Zed Run is a horse racing game that prides itself on being the meeting point between horse racing and blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>Zed Run integrates horse racing with blockchain technology, the metaverse, and NFTs in an open market.</p>\n<p>Zed Run launched in January 2019 as the first Non-Fungible Token (NFT) project that enabled users to buy, breed, and race their very own digital racehorses, which are represented in the form of NFTs.</p>\n<h2><strong>How Does it Work?</strong></h2>\n<p>Launched in 2018 in Australia by Virtually Human Studio, with over one million completed races, Zed Run allows players to buy, breed, and race digital NFT horses. There are currently over two hundred thousand horses in the game, and the horses (NFT characters) are split up into four bloodlines: Nakamoto (the rarest), Szabo, Finney, and Buterin (the most common).</p>\n<p>Contrary to the traditional chance-focused horse racing games, Zed Run is a skill and strategy game, with the likelihood of a horse winning a race being determined by characteristics such as bloodline, genotype, and breed type.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to Get Started in Zed Run</strong></h2>\n<p>To get started, you begin the game by creating an account (a &#8220;stable&#8221;) through the <a href=\"https://zed.run/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">official Zed Run website</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you're done setting up your account, you can go ahead and purchase a starting racehorse through the official Zed Run OpenSea collection.</p>\n<p>Once you've completed the purchase of your first horse, you can participate in the &#8220;discovery races&#8221; to get you ready to compete in races for prize money.</p>\n<p>To compete in races with a prize pool, you must pay a buy-in fee, and the higher the buy-in, the higher the prize pool.</p>\n<p>In most of these races, 12 horses that belong to a similar class compete against each other, and the first six horses to cross the finish line earn a share of the prize money.</p>\n<p>The higher you finish among the six horses, the higher the percentage of the prize pool you earn.</p>\n<h2><strong>How To Earn Money In Zed Run</strong></h2>\n<p>To earn money in Zed Run, you need to first purchase a racehorse. Racehorses are available on the <a href=\"https://opensea.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenSea NFT marketplace</a> for as little as $10, so buying one shouldn't be a financial burden.</p>\n<p>Once you've completed the purchase of your racehorse, you can earn crypto by winning races or breeding and selling prized horses.</p>\n<p>To increase your chances of winning a race, you can either get a better horse, either by buying or breeding one, or simply participate in races in a lower class where your horse stands a chance of winning.</p>\n<p>You can withdraw your crypto earnings at any point or convert them to fiat money as you withdraw.</p>\n",

What are the exciting features that make it different from other games?</p>\n<p>These and many more questions will be answered in this article.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is The Six Dragons (TSD)?¬†</strong></h2>\n<p>The Six of Dragons (TSD) is an open-world RPG adventure game inspired by iconic games such as Skyrim.</p>\n<p>The game is a free-to-play single-player fantasy RPG that is based on the blockchain and uses features such as blockchain technology, passive income, player ownership of NFT in-game assets, and governance (player control) to create an adventurous game that provides an exciting user experience to gamers.</p>\n<h2><strong>How Does it Work?</strong></h2>\n<p>Set in the fantasy world of Nemberus, TSD is an adventure game with a 256 km2 map of open land and 1 billion dungeons that players can explore.</p>\n<p>The game features three character types, which are warriors, wizards, and clerics, and you come across these characters in different monster-like forms as your adventure takes you through the forests, mountains, lakes, and rivers, scattered with villages, dungeons, arenas, and castles.</p>\n<p>In the fight against these characters, you need swords for warriors, staffs for wizards, and maces for clerics, with 26 variants of each weapon.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile: <a href=\"https://r.atlasearth.com/ykDj6L08eub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Atlas Earth is offering passive income opportunities that gamers can't resist.</a></p>\n<p>As a player, you start the game at level 1 (Lv1) and reach higher levels when you earn XP points through various in-game interactions, such as collecting materials or killing monsters.</p>\n<p>As you reach higher levels, the skills of your hero, the monsters you will encounter, the level of portals and dungeons you will find, and the in-game items such as weapons and armor that you have all change and improve.</p>\n<p>You can hunt for loot, farm for resources, upgrade their skills, and craft new items like weapons and armor via the Blockchain Blacksmith Service feature in TSD.</p>\n<p>The Blockchain Blacksmith Service feature allows players to craft new tokenized in-game items by paying other members of the community who act as blacksmiths.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to Start Playing The Six Dragons</strong></h2>\n<p>As someone who's new to the Six Dragons game, there are a couple of steps you need to take to start playing the game; here's a step-by-step guide on how to get started.</p>\n<h3>1. Install¬†¬†<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enjin.mobile.wallet&hl=en&gl=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Enjin Wallet</strong></a></h3>\n<p>TSD is an Ethereum blockchain-based game, so you need a blockchain wallet to start playing the game.</p>\n<p>Enjin Wallet is the only wallet currently supported for playing the game in blockchain mode.</p>\n<p>The wallet allows you to use your crypto and NFT assets in-game as well as receive the items you earn from the game straight to your wallet.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Register your account</strong></h3>\n<p>Once you've installed and connected your wallet with the game, the next step is to register your account in the game.</p>\n<p>On the main menu, select the &#8220;Blockchain Login&#8221; option and choose &#8220;Register new user,&#8221; then fill in your personal information, such as your email address, username, and password. Press &#8220;Register&#8221; once you've filled in the information and wait for an email that confirms your registration.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Start Playing the Game</strong></h3>\n<p>Once you've received the confirmation email, go ahead and start playing the game.</p>\n<h2><strong>Amazing Features of the Six Dragons</strong></h2>\n<p>From an adventurous theme that takes you through forests, mountains, lakes, rivers, villages, dungeons, arenas, and castles to the NFT assets that the game allows you to craft and sell to other players on the marketplace, here are some features of the six dragons.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Player ownership and control</strong></h3>\n<p>Player ownership and control of in-game assets is the backbone of TSD; the project uses tokenized ownership governance that gives control to players and allows them to vote on decisions that affect the game and community at large.</p>\n<p>As a player, you can create weapons, items, and equipment on the Ethereum blockchain and freely sell or trade them with other players on the NFT marketplace, thus creating a player-driven, decentralized financial economy.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Blockchain-based Gaming</strong></h3>\n<p>Every aspect of the Six Dragons game is on the blockchain; you can play the game on the blockchain and also send and receive your in-game assets through the NFT marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Passive Income</strong></h3>\n<p>Holders of the Six Dragons governance NFT earn passive income through a revenue share over all in-game transactions from trading and item creation.</p>\n<p><strong>Should You Invest in the Six Dragons?</strong></p>\n<p>The first thing you need to understand is that the game is free-to-play, although you can buy in-game assets to upgrade your weapons and increase your earning potential.</p>\n<p>However, whether you choose to invest your money is at your own discretion, and it's more advisable to consider doing so after you've played the game to some extent.</p>\n",

    "encoded_content": "<p>Nine Chronicles joins a long list of play-to-earn (P2E) games that have launched in recent years.</p>\n<p>These play-to-earn games aim to change the way the financial system works in the gaming space through the power of blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>And using cryptocurrencies and NFTs, they have made it possible for gamers to earn rewards for investing both time and money in games.</p>\n<p>However, despite the potential in the blockchain gaming industry, there have been hits and misses, with many P2E games failing to deliver on their promises to gamers.</p>\n<p>So with all these happenings in the blockchain gaming space, is Nine Chronicles a hit or a miss? And should you invest your time and money in this game?</p>\n<p>Let's find out these answers and more in this article.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is Nine Chronicles?</strong></h2>\n<p>Nine Chronicles is a free-to-play MMORPG game that combines gameplay, mining, and governance using the blockchain to allow players to trade the digital assets they earn in game while also converting their computing power into $NCG tokens (Nine Chronicles Gold).</p>\n<p>The game features players exploring the nine realms and competing with other players in the dungeons so they can get raw materials to craft unique items they can use to improve the way they play the game.</p>\n<p>The unique items they find can be used to enhance their skills or traded for cryptocurrency or NFTs with other players.</p>\n<h2><strong>How Does Nine Chronicles Work?</strong></h2>\n<p>Unlike in traditional games, in which a gaming company operates the game and decides the gameplay, fees, eligibility criteria, and other aspects of the game, Nine Chronicles uses a different mode of operation.</p>\n<p>Just like Bitcoin, the Nine Chronicles platform is a decentralized open-source ecosystem in which gamers and miners connect to each other to power a distributed game network.</p>\n<p>In addition, the game is governed by its players, with miners and gamers playing a part in the decision-making process for running the game and the community at large.</p>\n<p>In return for their in-game activities and mining operations, gamers and miners are rewarded with NFTs and $NCG (the governance currency of the Nine Chronicles platform).</p>\n<h3><strong>How to Start Playing Nine Chronicles</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>To get started, go to <a href=\"http://nine-chronicles.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://nine-chronicles.com</a>.</li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Play Now&#8221; button on the homepage.</li>\n<li>After that, you'll be asked to sign in with your Twitter account so you can get your invitation code.</li>\n<li>The installer is downloaded automatically, after which you will click the &#8220;Create Account&#8221; button and enter information such as your password and username.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Amazing Features of Nine Chronicles</strong></h2>\n<p>Nine Chronicles has some amazing features that make it different from just a mere addition to the play-to-earn games currently live on blockchains.</p>\n<p>Here are some amazing features of The Nine Chronicles.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Open-source decentralized ecosystem</strong></h3>\n<p>The standout feature of the gaming platform is its open-source method of data storage and processing.</p>\n<p>The game isn't stored on a centralized server or controlled by a central authority; it's a community-driven project, with members of the community powering the game and deciding on new features, updates, and other additions that affect the game.</p>\n<p>As it's an open-source ecosystem like Bitcoin, changes such as the creation of new characters, potions, skins, and other in-game assets can be made by the community without the need for approval from the developers or creators of the game.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Blockchain Technology</strong></h3>\n<p>Nine Chronicles is a blockchain-based game; every aspect of the game is entirely built on the <a href=\"https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Libplanet</a> blockchain, a distributed ledger technology used to create decentralized games that use a peer-to-peer network rather than a centralized server.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Play-to-earn (P2E)</strong></h3>\n<p>The game makes it possible for players and miners to earn NFT collectibles, which they can trade with other players in the community.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Mining</strong></h3>\n<p>Mining is another fantastic addition to the Nine Chronicles platform.</p>\n<p>Gamers and miners contribute their computing power to the blockchain network to help verify data.</p>\n<p>In return for the computing power that they contribute, they are rewarded 10 NCG tokens per block mined.</p>\n<p>However, the block rewards get halved every 4 years, with the next halving happening by 2024, and the reward for each block mined will be reduced to 5 NCG tokens.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. NCG (Nine Chronicles Gold)</strong></h3>\n<p>Nine Chronicles Gold ($NCG) is the native currency of the Nine Chronicles ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Players can use NCG to purchase items from other players, craft and upgrade powerful items, challenge other players, and accelerate growth.</p>\n<p>Players need to stake NCG to receive items such as AP potions, hourglasses, and other limited consumables that are crucial for the character's growth acceleration.</p>\n<p>Though staking NCG isn't necessary when you start playing, the game is designed so that NCG's needs are gradually increased as you progress through the game and achieve new levels.</p>\n<p>Apart from mining, players can earn $NCG tokens by crafting and selling NFT items on the marketplace, by participating in the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/9c-eco-support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ecosystem support program</a>, or through giveaways on Nine Chronicles' platforms.</p>\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\n<p>Nine Chronicles is a fantastic game, with various amazing features that make the game a good prospect.</p>\n<p>Though some levels of the game are yet to be launched, it's still a gaming project that you should look into, especially if you're looking to earn rewards.</p>\n",

    "encoded_content": "<p>Various fantastic play-to-earn (P2E) games have been launched on blockchains in the gaming industry.</p>\n<p>These games have offered gamers the opportunity to earn rewards while doing what they love.</p>\n<p>In fact, with the emergence of P2E gaming, players no longer have to invest in video games without getting anything in return. They can now earn money from playing both the games that they invested in and those they play for free.</p>\n<p>At the very top of the list among these fantastic P2E games is Axie Infinity, the play-to-earn game that served as a source of income to both gamers and non-gamers during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.</p>\n<p>In this article, you'll learn what Axie Infinity is all about and how you can earn money playing the NFT game.</p>\n<h2>What is Axie Infinity?</h2>\n<p>Axie Infinity is a Pokemon-themed NFT metaverse game based on the Ethereum blockchain and developed by Sky Mavis.</p>\n<p>To play the game, you need &#8220;Axies&#8221;, which are NFT characters that you can collect or mint in order to grow, build, hunt for treasures, and go to battle with them.</p>\n<p>Apart from the native game, the metaverse platform also serves as an ecosystem of NFT metaverse games, allowing users to create games on their virtual land using the Lunacia SDK.</p>\n<p>In short, you can create your own metaverse game as long as you own a parcel of land on the Axie Infinity platform.</p>\n<p>You can design your game using the Lunacia SDK, after which the game is saved as an NFT tradeable on the NFT marketplace.</p>\n<p>For other users to play your game, they can locate your NFT land on the Axie Infinity map, click on it, and automatically gain access to your game.</p>\n<h2>How to Get Started with Axie Infinity</h2>\n<p>To play the game, you need to purchase three &#8220;Axies&#8221;, which are NFT characters that are used as pets to play the Axie Infinity game, and also farm Smooth Love Potions (SLP) , a token used to reward players in-game.</p>\n<p>Here are things to do to start playing Axie Infinity.</p>\n<p>1. Create a MetaMask wallet and fund it with (ETH) Ethereum tokens.</p>\n<p>2. Go to the official Axie Infinity NFT marketplace or OpenSea to purchase three &#8216;Axies'.</p>\n<p>3. Go to the official website and download the Axie Infinity game.</p>\n<p>The app isn't yet available on the Playstore for mobile phones, so here are things to do to download the app on your mobile phone:</p>\n<p>Go to https://axieinfinity.com/ and select &#8220;Play Now&#8221; in the upper right corner of the page.</p>\n<p>Select &#8220;Android&#8221; and then click &#8220;install&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Once you've installed the app, you're free to start growing, building, and hunting for treasures with your &#8220;Axies&#8221;, while you also earn SLP tokens in passive income for holding &#8220;Axies.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Amazing Features of Axie Infinity</h2>\n<h3>1. Axie NFTs</h3>\n<p>Axies are pets used to play Axie Infinity. They can be bred with SLP tokens or purchased on an NFT marketplace.</p>\n<p>Axies come in different characteristics and base classes, and there are nine different base classes of axies in the Axie Infinity metaverse.</p>\n<p>They are: plant, reptile, aqua, bird, beast, bug, mech, dusk, and dawn.</p>\n<p>Each Axie belongs to one or two of these base classes and has four additional qualities in health, speed, skills, and morale with its base class.</p>\n<p>One of the best perks of owning an Axie is that you can earn energy potions which can yield SLP tokens as a holder of an Axie NFT.</p>\n<h3>2.Governance Tokens</h3>\n<p>Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) and Smooth Love Potions (SLP) are the two native currencies of the Axie Infinity game and both have their specific usages in the Axie Infinity community.</p>\n<p>The basic usecase of AXS is to allow you and other members of the community to participate in the decision-making process of running the Axie Infinity metaverse.</p>\n<p>SLP, on the other hand, is used to breed &#8220;Axies&#8221;, though it is also used to reward players in-game.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile: <a href=\"https://www.jasper.ai/?special=qUo64YY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can create NFTs in minutes with this software</a>.</p>\n<h3>3. Create Your Own Metaverse Game</h3>\n<p>If you've been dreaming of launching your own metaverse game, the Axie Infinity metaverse platform can make your dream come true.</p>\n<p>Apart from the Axie Infinity game, Axie Infinity also serves as a metaverse ecosystem for gamers where people can launch their own games and invite other gamers to play the game, participate in competitions and win prizes.</p>\n<h3>4. Access to a Wide Variety of Metaverse Gaming Experiences</h3>\n<p>Another interesting feature of the Axie Infinity game is that you can get to play a variety of games and also interact with other gamers to create an immersive and interesting gaming experience.</p>\n<h2>Should You Play Axie Infinity?</h2>\n<p>If there are play-to-earn games that you should give a shot to, then Axie Infinity is one of them.</p>\n<p>What Axie Infinity has achieved as a P2E metaverse game is still unmatched in the gaming industry.</p>\n<p>In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, playing Axie Infinity served as a source of income for Filipinos and other people around the world who couldn't go to work due to the lockdown caused by the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Millions of Gamers have since adopted the game as not only a source of entertainment but also a means through which they can generate passive income.</p>\n<p>Therefore, yes, you should play Axie Infinity.</p>\n",

Its decentralized nature offers unparalleled transparency and security that traditional systems cannot match.  In this blog post, we will explore how blockchain can help break down barriers in international trade by creating new opportunities for innovation-driven value creation.</p>\n<h2>What is Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?</h2>\n<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a revolutionary concept that utilizes blockchain technology to create transparent,  secure and low cost platforms for trading, lending borrowing or investment purposes. By eliminating intermediaries such as banks or other financial institutions from the equation users can access these services directly over distributed ledger networks without relying on third parties. This creates an inclusive system where anyone with internet connectivity has equal opportunities in global markets regardless of their backgrounds. With DeFis innovative approach towards financial services it offers unprecedented levels of transparency and security while reducing costs significantly compared to traditional methods.</p>\n<h2>Blockchain Technology and International Trade</h2>\n<p>International trade has long been plagued by slow cross border payments and settlements that are both expensive to process while also being vulnerable to fraudulent activity.

With blockchain based solutions businesses can enjoy enhanced supply chain visibility alongside reduced transaction fees as well as increased efficiency in their operations overall.  By embracing this innovative approach companies have the opportunity to streamline international transactions like never before seen before!</p>\n<h2>DEX &#8211; Facilitating Cross-Border Transactions</h2>\n<p>International trade has been revolutionized by blockchain technology through the use of decentralized exchanges (DEX). These platforms allow buyers and sellers from around the world to connect directly without intermediaries like brokers or custodians. This provides greater control over assets while reducing counterparty risks associated with centralized exchanges. Additionally, DEX offers increased liquidity at lower fees than traditional methods &#8211; making it ideal for cross border transactions.

These innovative tools eliminate many challenges associated with cross border trades such as language barriers,  legal issues and cultural differences that can hinder progress for companies looking to expand globally. With smart contracts in place these obstacles become less daunting allowing more seamless operations across borders. The potential benefits include increased efficiency gains from streamlined transactions leading towards greater profitability overall.</p>\n<h2>Cryptocurrency Innovation &#8211; Unlocking Value</h2>\n<p>In summary blockchain technology presents an exciting opportunity for breaking down barriers in international trade.

    "encoded_content": "<p>The rise of cryptocurrencies has led many people to explore alternative ways for investing their money and earning profits.  One such option is Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) which have been gaining attention in recent times due to their unique features compared with fungible tokens. In this article we will provide an overview on what NFTs are all about including how they differ from other digital assets while also explaining why they&#8217;re causing a stir among finance enthusiasts worldwide.</p>\n<h2>What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?</h2>\n<p>Non fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent specific items or objects. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin which can be divided into smaller units each NFT represents a single indivisible item.  For instance an NFT could signify ownership of rare virtual goods in video games or real world assets such as artwork pieces. The uniqueness and singularity associated with these tokens make them highly sought after among collectors who value their rarity and exclusivity.</p>\n<h2>Fungible vs Non-Fungible Tokens &#8211; What&#8217;s the Difference?</h2>\n<p>The primary difference between fungible and non fungible tokens lies in their divisibility. Fungible tokens like Bitcoin can be split into smaller pieces while still retaining value whereas non fungibles cannot be divided or combined with other tokens without losing uniqueness.  This key distinction highlights the importance of understanding how each type works when investing in cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<h2>NFTs and the Gaming Industry &#8211; A Revolution</h2>\n<p>NFTs have revolutionized the gaming industry by introducing a new dimension to virtual item collecting. Traditionally these items held no real world value beyond their use within games themselves; however with NFT technology players can now buy sell and trade them like any other form of property creating an entirely fresh marketplace within this sector.  The rarity factor has driven up prices significantly for some particularly sought after NFTs &#8211; with values reaching into hundreds or even thousands of dollars! This innovation is changing how gamers approach gameplay while also opening doors for entrepreneurs looking to capitalize on this growing trend in digital asset management.</p>\n<h2>NFT Investing &#8211; The Pros and Cons</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://defi-gamefi.com/why-nfts-are-the-future-of-digital-art-and-collectibles-and-how-to-get-started-with-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Investing in NFTs</a> comes with both risks and rewards. While there is potential for high returns if you can identify undervalued tokens early on, investors should also be aware of the inherent risk involved.  Additionally these assets offer a degree of independence from government regulation due to their lack of ties with any particular currency or financial institution. As such it&#8217;s important that those considering this type of investment carefully weigh all factors before making decisions about where best to allocate funds.</p>\n<p>Investing in NFTs carries significant risk due to their novelty and untested nature. The long term viability of these assets remains uncertain since they are still relatively new on the market. Moreover, prices can fluctuate rapidly causing volatility within this sector making it challenging for investors who seek stability over time. Additionally,  fraudulent activities may occur outside traditional financial institutions where many transactions take place adding another layer of uncertainty when considering an investment into NFTs.</p>\n<h2>Tokenized Real-World Assets &#8211; A New Era of Ownership</h2>\n<p>The potential of NFT technology extends beyond just digital assets. With the ability to tokenize real world items like artwork or intellectual property, owners can now divide and sell off parts of these valuable possessions to multiple buyers without losing control over them entirely. This creates a new level of flexibility for investors who may not have had access beforehand due to high costs associated with owning such assets outright.  The possibilities are endless when it comes to what types of physical objects could be represented as non fungible tokens in this way &#8211; from luxury goods like cars or jewelry all the way up to entire buildings! As more people become aware of how powerful this tool is they will no doubt start exploring its full range of applications even further.</p>\n<h2>The Future of NFTs &#8211; Where It&#8217;s Headed</h2>\n<p>NFTs are a fascinating technology that has captured the attention of many people across various industries. While its difficult to predict exactly where they will go in future years; given their current popularity and versatility it seems likely that NFTs will continue playing an important role within finance as well as other areas such as supply chain management,  voting systems or even identity verification processes. With so much potential for growth we can only wait with anticipation what new applications this exciting technology may bring us!</p>\n<h2>NFTs &#8211; Everything You Need to Know</h2>\n<p>NFTs are a fascinating frontier in the world of digital assets. Whether you&#8217;re interested in investing or following their development as an intriguing new technology there is much to look forward to ahead. With so many possibilities and applications for this innovative approach it seems clear that NFTs will continue making waves within both finance and tech industries alike.  As such anyone with even passing interest should keep tabs on what comes next!</p></p><p>The post <a href=\"https://defi-gamefi.com/nfts-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-this-explosive-new-market/\">NFTs 101: Everything You Need to Know About This Explosive New Market</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://defi-gamefi.com\"></a>.</p>",

Similarly some games have adopted play-to-earn models that reward players with cryptocurrencies like BTC or ETH for completing challenges or reaching milestones. In addition DeFis impact on game economies cannot go unnoticed &#8211; popular titles such as Counter Strike Global Offensive and Dota 2 now feature vibrant skin markets where players may trade cosmetic items directly using cryptocurrency rather than relying solely upon centralized exchanges.

    "encoded_content": "<p>The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has sparked curiosity among individuals seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems. With its focus on transparency,  security and efficiency DeFis impact is transforming how people view money management. This blog post delves into the role that decentralized exchanges play within this landscape by exploring their significance in relation to other aspects of DeFi.</p>\n<h2>Decentralized Finance &#8211; What It Is and Its Impact</h2>\n<p>Decentralized finance refers to any financial system or application that operates without central control or intermediaries. This approach utilizes consensus mechanisms such as blockchain technology for verification of transactions by network participants instead of relying on a single authority figure. The result is increased transparency,  security and efficiency in managing assets while conducting transactions. With this innovative methodology at play we can expect greater accountability from those involved with our money matters than ever before!</p>\n<p>DeFi&#8217;s ability to eliminate middlemen and reduce transaction costs is one of its most significant advantages.  By removing intermediaries from the equation users can save both time and money while also reducing risk exposure. Additionally DeFis reliance on cryptographic algorithms rather than trust based relationships ensures greater security and immutability compared with traditional financial systems. This makes it an attractive option for those seeking more efficient transactions without compromising safety or stability.</p>\n<p>DeFi has the potential to revolutionize accessibility in finance by enabling anyone with an internet connection worldwide participation in global markets. This could help bridge gaps between developed and developing economies through democratization of financial services.  The possibilities are endless!</p>\n<h2>Blockchain Technology and Its Role in DeFi &#8211; The Rise</h2>\n<p>Blockchain technology has revolutionized the world of finance by enabling decentralization through its tamper proof ledger system. This innovative approach allows for secure and transparent record keeping across all transactions while also facilitating automated execution via smart contracts &#8211; self executing programs written on top of blockchains.  By eliminating human intervention from complex financial agreements this groundbreaking technology is transforming how we conduct business today.</p>\n<h2>The Advantages of Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)</h2>\n<p>A decentralized exchange is a type of digital asset trading platform that allows buyers and sellers to conduct transactions directly with each other without the need for intermediaries. Unlike centralized exchanges which are controlled by single entities DEXs use distributed ledgers to facilitate peer-to-peer trades. This innovative approach offers greater transparency, security,  and control over ones investments. With no middleman involved in these transactions there&#8217;s less risk of fraud or manipulation from third parties. Additionally users can enjoy faster processing times since they don&#8217;t have to wait on approvals from an external authority before completing their trades. Overall decentralized exchanges offer more freedom and flexibility when it comes to managing your assets online.</p>\n<p>When it comes to choosing between centralized exchanges and decentralized ones (DEXs) there are several advantages that make the latter stand out. Firstly DEXs offer increased privacy by storing user funds locally on their devices rather than holding them centrally which reduces risk of hacking or fraudulent activity.  Secondly these platforms typically have lower fees since they eliminate intermediaries altogether &#8211; making transactions more cost effective for traders who use them regularly. Finally cross chain trading capabilities enable greater liquidity across multiple blockchains simultaneously through a single platform &#8211; something not possible with traditional exchanges. Overall DEXs provide an attractive alternative worth considering when deciding where best to trade cryptocurrencies online.</p>\n<h2>The Future of Finance &#8211; DeFi Transformation</h2>\n<p>Decentralized finance marks a significant departure from traditional financial models towards an open,  transparent and secure system.

    "encoded_content": "\n<p>The advent of blockchain technology circa 2008 was the starting shot for deep changes in how business is conducted across many sectors. From supply chain to entertainment, decentralised technology is finding its way into more and more use cases every day. The gaming industry is no exception. Blockchain now supports the Play-to-Earn (P2E) model, in which gamers can monetise their assets. This article explains the history of P2E and its mechanics and offers a comprehensive guide to help developers understand the concepts that underpin P2E models.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls poster=\"https://zaisan.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/benefits-of-web3-gaming.jpg\" src=\"https://5261994.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5261994/Video/QandA/Q&amp;A%20with%20Adam%20-%20What%20are%20the%20benefits%20of%20web3%20gaming.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A look back in time</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The year 2013 was chock-full of quirks. Onesies, those one-piece, often colorful jumpsuits for adults, became a thing this year. Also, selfie was named as word of the year by the Oxford Dictionary. US President Barack Obama -who, incidentally, was inaugurated for his second term in office in early 2013- became one of the high-profile personalities taking to the selfie craze with gusto. Hillary Clinton did, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the crypto world, Bitcoin was on the rise, though its valuation fluctuated wildly throughout the year. The mother of all cryptos started 2013 with a worth of $13 per coin before reaching a peak price of $1,100 by December. As Bitcoin floundered, a related concept made its appearance: blockchain gaming. Huntercoin, the precursor of the Play-to-Earn (P2E) model, was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huntercoin is built on the concept of &#8216;human mining.&#8217; Whereas traditional Bitcoin mining requires powerful computer rigs and vast amounts of power to mine new coins, Huntercoin distributes coins around its gaming world. Players create Hunters (for a fee) to move around the map collecting coins, which must be deposited into banks that are randomly generated at regular intervals. From there, the coins can be redeemed into the Hunter&#8217;s (the player) wallet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project proved that the combination of blockchain -a technology still relatively new in 2013- and gaming could work. But just as the P2E industry was starting to find a solid footing, the <a href=\"https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mt-gox-hack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mt. Gox hack</a> happened. Though specifically related to Bitcoin exchange facility, the popular perception of blockchain as a &#8216;fraud&#8217; or &#8216;scam&#8217; took hold. The consequences of the spectacular fall of Mt. Gox rippled out across the industry. Many nascent P2E projects were halted or canned altogether, as blockchain became almost toxic. It would be several years before P2E made a significant comeback.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2017: the year of the virtual cat</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cats are immensely popular animals on social media. &#8216;Funny cat videos&#8217; tend to accrue hundreds of thousands of videos on TikTok or YouTube. And back in 2017, felines spread their domain into the crypto space through CryptoKitties, a P2E game that enabled gamers to purchase NFTs depicting cute cats. Over time, players could breed their NFT pets to create new ones, and so the cycle continued.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CryptoKitties became the first more or less mainstream blockchain game. And it made some respectable amount of money, too. The most expensive CryptoKitty ever sold, a purple creature by the name of Dragon, fetched $1.3m (around 600 ETH at the time.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advent (and success) of the virtual cat game reignited interest in blockchain gaming, opening the floodgates for a rush of P2E games that continues to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls poster=\"https://zaisan.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gamefi-need-to-go-mainstream.jpg\" src=\"https://5261994.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5261994/Video/QandA/Q&amp;A%20with%20Adam%20-%20What%20does%20gamefi%20need%20to%20go%20mainstream.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>But what exactly is P2E?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In other gaming models -notably, Pay to win (P2W) and Free to play (F2P), the revenue generated only goes one way: towards the game‚Äôs developers. Gamers themselves do not benefit financially. P2E turns this one-way street concept on its head by enabling gamers to financially benefit from the value they create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>P2E leverages the power of blockchain to create a fair and open economic environment where value is distributed among gamers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This model centers around the ownership of in-game assets. A core tenet of P2W and F2P is that, while gamers can purchase assets like weapons, skins, magic items, etc., they do not actually own them. The game‚Äôs developer retains ownership. What the gamer is purchasing is the right to use those assets in their game only. This means the gamer cannot trade these assets, and crucially, cannot use them in any other game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology subverts that concept. Blockchain is decentralised technology, which means there is no one single authority in control. And it further means that in-game assets are not stored in a centralised server, as is the case with P2W and F2P. Instead, assets are stored on all the nodes (computers) running that blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In P2E games, the gamers own the assets, which can increase in value in the game‚Äôs open economy. The more you play the game, the more value is generated, and the bigger the rewards for the player. These rewards can be additional in-game assets or resources or cryptocurrencies, all of which are tokenised in the blockchain. This is a key point. By tokenizing assets, the gamers can use them elsewhere. In another blockchain-based game, for instance, or by creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can be traded. All this generates more and more value for the blockchain gaming environment and the players.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Zaisan as the nexus for providing comprehensive P2E services</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering all the aspects explained above, companies require great expertise and understanding of the space to be able to provide efficient, comprehensive services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zaisan`fields that expertise, which enables the company to become the preferential choice for developers intending to create a P2E ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zaisan can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Deploy <a href=\"https://zaisan.io/services\">backend infrastructure</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer <a href=\"https://zaisan.io/services/web3-consultancy\">consulting services</a> to assist the client in choosing the right chain</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://zaisan.io/services/web3-consultancy\">Set up test environmen</a><a href=\"https://zaisan.io/infra/blockchain-consultancy\">ts</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://zaisan.io/services/web3-consultancy\">Set up a blockchain</a> customised to specifications</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Build <a href=\"https://zaisan.io/solutions/bridge\">blockchain bridges</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide <a href=\"https://zaisan.io/services/nft-project-management\">NFT project management</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Establish a <a href=\"https://zaisan.io/solutions/staking-platforms\">customised staking platform</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, identity is a key component of many aspects of life, and this includes blockchain environments, of course.

    "encoded_content": "\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">Featured image: <a href=\"https://r2-collectibles.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">R2-Rewards.com</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;ve got a nice collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). After a few months, you have managed to amass a respectable amount of those little digital wonders. You might have even been able to sell one or two, earning you enough for a couple cups of coffee in your nearest franchised outlet. But as you take sips off that hard-earned coffee and browse through your NFT portfolio, you can&#8217;t help but wonder about the value hidden there, just waiting to be uncovered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Question is, how to unlock the value in those NFTs?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">NFT staking: definition</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When they hear the word staking, most people&#8217;s minds would harken back to the old Hammer films, when the nefarious Dracula would meet his demise with a wooden stake through the heart. And yes, that is one traditional understanding of the word staking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s 2022 now, and though Count Dracula still roams somewhere down the darkest halls of our dreams, staking now means something altogether more profitable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s digital times, and in the context of NFTs, staking is sort of a game of investment/rewards. You commit (&#8216;lock&#8217;) your NFTs into a platform or a protocol for a set period of time, and you receive rewards (or other benefits) in exchange for such commitment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staking addresses one NFTs&#8217; inherent issue: liquidity. Remember, NFTs are tokenized assets that you can sell, trade, or, as we see in this article, stake for a yield. Staking enables earning passive income off your NFT portfolio while retaining ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fungible vs non-fungible: an explanation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The concepts of fungibility and non-fungibility had, for a long time, been well outside the layman‚Äôs lexicon. But once NFTs entered public discourse, people began to learn more about what these concepts mean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, fungibility means the possibility of using goods, items, or commodities interchangeably because they have the same value. Banknotes or coins, pieces of the same fruit, or a liter of petrol are good examples of fungibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-fungibility denotes uniqueness. Collectible items, including original oil paintings, baseball cards, art pieces, diamonds, and vintage cars can be considered non-fungible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the latter concept that emerges as most interesting, as non-fungibility carries value, and it is a value that NFT staking unlocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://zaisan.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nft-staking-geepeekay-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4100\"/><figcaption><sub>Image: <a href=\"https://r2-collectibles.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">R2-</a><a href=\"https://r2-rewards.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rewards.com</a></sub></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">NFT staking: how it works</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlocking the value of your NFTs through staking is easier than you think. All you need is a crypto wallet and, well, NFTs. The more the better. Then, choose a protocol or a platform to stake your NFTs in, and wait for the rewards, which might be distributed daily, weekly, or in any other fashion. It really is that simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NFT staking is akin to yield farming, insofar as you lock a certain amount of wealth (NFTs in this case) and receive a certain percentage of rewards based on the amount staked, the period of time that the NFTS will be locked, and other parameters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">All about staking rewards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you invest in traditional financial products (bonds, stocks, mutual funds, etc.), you expect your investment to produce a certain yield. Equally, the ultimate purpose of staking your NFTs is to get a return -a reward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this raises several questions: what kind of rewards do you get? And who issues those rewards?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you purchase an investment bond, your reward at the end of the investment term will usually be money, a certain percentage based on the bond&#8217;s performance, length of investment, etc. The staking rewards system works in a similar fashion. You lock your stake in for a certain amount of time and you get rewards. Some platforms might offer a fixed amount, while others might give users different amounts, depending on how many people are participating, and the total size of the rewards pool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And who pays these rewards? Well, the platform or protocol where you stake your NFTs. Normally, an algorithm would calculate the due rewards based on specified parameters, and the rewards would be deposited into your account at the agreed intervals. Now, what these rewards actually are, depends on the protocol or platform. Sometimes, you get the platform‚Äôs native tokens, other times you get tokens that you can exchange for fiat, and certain protocols issue tokens that can only be used within their own environment (a gaming platform, for example). Always check the terms and conditions when you sign up so you know exactly what rewards you will get, and how often.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Risk versus Reward</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As with most financial endeavors, returns are never guaranteed and are not entirely without risk. If you put up collateral it means you risk losing that. In the case of a staking system, there are often 2 things to keep in mind. First of all, in most staking systems you will need to purchase a staking key in order to get started. Buying the key can be seen as an entrance fee to the platform and there are often a variety of keys, ranging from cheap and small ones to big and expensive keys. Of course, you hope to earn your investment into the key back but this is never guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another risk is that the staking platform can get hacked and you may lose your NFTs since they&#8217;re not in your custody anymore. While the right permissions setup (along with responsible project owners) can drastically reduce this risk, hacks are and will always be a risk for platforms holding considerable amounts of value.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NFT staking is a subset of the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It is a relatively new practice in the space, but there already are several NFT management companies that offer staking services, including Zaisan, which launched a <a href=\"https://r2-rewards.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">staking platform in collaboration with R2</a>. While there is an inherent risk to using and creating a staking platform, this risk can be minimised by choosing the right partners and using secure setups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, staking is just another cool utility of NFTs, which are proving to be rather versatile assets that break new ground almost every day.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zaisan.io/nft-staking-explained/\">NFT Staking Explained: Generating Value</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zaisan.io\">Zaisan</a>.</p>\n",

    "encoded_content": "\n<p>Public blockchain technology evolves at a rapid pace. Bitcoin, which officially released in 2009, already feels ancient compared to modern-day blockchain technology when looking at it from a technological perspective. In this article, we take a look at the <a href=\"https://on.wax.io/wax-io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WAX blockchain</a> and what it has to offer, and look into if it is a suitable option for the next generation of <a href=\"https://zaisan.io/services/nft-project-management\">NFT and GameFi projects</a> and platforms.¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls poster=\"https://zaisan.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/benefits-of-web3-gaming.jpg\" src=\"https://5261994.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5261994/Video/QandA/Q&amp;A%20with%20Adam%20-%20What%20are%20the%20benefits%20of%20web3%20gaming.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is WAX?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The King of NFTs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let‚Äôs start with an explanation of the WAX blockchain first. WAX describes itself in the following way: ‚ÄúWAX is the most used and transacted blockchain ecosystem in the world for NFTs, dApps and video games ‚Äî providing the safest and most convenient way to create, buy, sell and trade both virtual and physical items to anyone, anywhere in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Known best as ‚ÄúThe King of NFTs‚Äù, WAX is the leading NFT network and has successfully facilitated the trade of millions of NFTs from partners including Topps (Major League Baseball), Capcom (Street Fighter), Funko, Atari, Sony‚Äôs Funimation, and famous films (Princess Bride and SAW), world-renowned entertainers (Deadmau5, Weezer and William Shatner), and many more.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Resource model and consensus mechanism</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The blockchain distinguishes itself from other blockchains in various ways. The first and foremost is the resource mechanism. While a transfer of an NFT can cost tens of dollars and take minutes on a network like Ethereum, a similar transaction on WAX is both free and takes only 0.5 seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is thanks to the resource model and consensus mechanism the WAX blockchain uses. It uses a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) mechanism, which is a <a href=\"https://medium.com/hackernoon/different-blockchain-consensus-mechanisms-d19ea6c3bcd6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">third generation consensus mechanism</a> in which token holders get to elect their top 21 block producers (miners). Thanks to the high efficiency of the consensus mechanism it is capable of supporting thousands of transactions per second.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Staking model</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, WAX uses a staking model rather than a transaction cost model. On most blockchains, the user pays a fee for each transaction. The size of the fee is often dictated by the kind of transaction and how busy the network is at the time of the transaction. On WAX however, transactions are free. In order to perform transactions on WAX users need to stake some WAXP tokens. By staking their tokens, users are entitled to a certain portion of the available network resources which allows them to execute transactions on the networks. The more WAXP a user stakes, the more transactions they are able to make in a certain time frame (as the resources replenish again with time).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Network governance system</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WAX also has a comprehensive network governance system called the Office Inspector General (OIG). The OIG monitors and collects data from block producers and provides an objective ranking of each block producer every month based on a comprehensive framework. This makes the block producer positions highly competitive and incentivises block producers to do more than just producing blocks. This has led to a stable infrastructure with a wide array of tools available for both developers and users. But what does all of this mean for WAX‚Äôs ability to support NFT and GameFi projects?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of Using WAX for NFTs</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">No transaction costs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let‚Äôs start with the benefits of using WAX for NFTs! As is evident from the description of WAX above, there are various benefits to using WAX for NFTs over a blockchain like Ethereum. The most obvious benefit is the lack of transaction cost. This might not seem like a major difference, but this opens up a whole new realm of opportunities for NFT platforms and games. More on this will follow in the GameFi section.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Low cost of creating NFTs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another major benefit is the low cost of creating NFTs. Creating NFTs on a blockchain like Ethereum can cost tens of dollars, whereas the cost of creating an NFT is 151kb of RAM on the blockchain, which at the time of writing corresponds to 0.09 WAX, which has a value of $0.03. This combined with free transactions makes creating and trading NFTs accessible to everyone, and also allows the creation of more interesting concepts which do not have to rely on a high price of the NFT(s) in question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common ways in which NFTs are sold within the WAX ecosystem, for example, are packs. Packs can be seen as a bag of NFTs which can contain a certain amount of NFTs. The NFTs that are in the pack can be decided by the creator. These packs follow a rarity structure, which determines how likely a certain (kind of) NFT is to appear in a pack. A concept like this is possible on WAX since the cost of creating NFTs is very low.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Large and convenient marketplace</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to an ecosystem that is supportive of NFTs, WAX also hosts one of the biggest, and arguably most convenient NFT marketplaces in the crypto ecosystem, namely <a href=\"https://wax.atomichub.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Atomichub</a>. By having well-defined NFT standards and a swift and scalable network, Atomichub is able to support the instant selling and trading of NFTs. And in addition to this, they have an intuitive NFT creator which allows anyone with a WAX account to create an NFT in minutes at no additional cost. Additionally, tools like Neftyblocks allow the creation of packs for free as well, providing creators with all the tools they need to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A blockchain on the rise</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are many benefits to using WAX for NFTs, there‚Äôs also a downside to consider. The NFT ecosystem on a blockchain like Ethereum may not be as technologically advanced, the whole ecosystem surrounding it is bigger and more mature. However, WAX has been on the rise and has a fast-growing amount of projects being built on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of Using WAX for GameFi</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Support thousands of users</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But WAX is not just for NFTs, it‚Äôs proven to be a very viable place for the next generation of blockchain games as well. The fee-less transaction model along with a highly scalable network has allowed the creation of games that are able to support thousands of users without issue, and this also shows in the <a href=\"https://dappradar.com/rankings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dapp ranking by DappRadar</a>, with many of the top games running on WAX.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Leveraging NFTs in-game</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to its ability to handle a high amount of transactions, the relatively cheap NFTs also provide a lot of opportunities for games. Games are leveraging this by including NFTs in a lot of aspects of their game, using them for governance, battles, and more. Some developers are even taking their game to the next level by <a href=\"https://zaisan.io/solutions/bridge\">deploying their game on multiple blockchains</a>, allowing them to deploy the most demanding aspects of their game on the WAX blockchain, while also taking advantage of the user bases on other blockchains.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trusted marketplace</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, the aforementioned marketplace, Atomichub, provides a trusted and convenient place for players of the games to buy, trade, and sell their in-game assets. The marketplace also uses a verification system, protecting users against counterfeit NFTs and allowing developers to add credibility to their project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WAX is a solid blockchain targeted at the NFT and gaming sector and has been successful so far in creating an environment in which these kinds of projects can flourish. The transaction model and its ability to handle high volumes of transactions make it one of the most viable blockchains for any NFT and gaming project. Furthermore, the ecosystem surrounding the blockchain provides another layer of tools and marketplaces which make everything more accessible.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zaisan.io/benefits-wax-nft-gamefi/\">Benefits of Using the WAX Blockchain for NFTs and GameFi</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zaisan.io\">Zaisan</a>.</p>\n",

    "encoded_content": "\n<p>The blockchain world moves at an incredible speed with technological breakthroughs being the norm instead of a once-in-a-lifetime event. Therefore it goes without saying that the applications being built on top of these blockchains are moving very fast as well. While blockchain started as a novel technology only being used in Bitcoin, the development of the technology has led to the adoption in almost every industry and this has created a case for blockchains targeted at specific use-cases and industries, in order to better serve specific needs. But this has also led to these blockchains being siloed off from each other. Would it be possible to connect these blockchains?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Europechain is a GDPR supporting enterprise blockchain platform managed and governed by experienced validators registered in the European Union.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connecting blockchains: the multi-chain future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine a group of small islands dotted around an area of an ocean. Each island has a small settlement of people, going about their business and living their lives as best they know how. But there&#8217;s a problem. One island has wood, but little food. They can build rudimentary huts but can scarcely eat. Their closest island has plenty of food though, but no wood, so they lack shelter. A third island has both wood and food, but no hay for their animals. Another island is brimming with hay, but little coal to light fires. The island with the wood does have good coal reserves though. Then, one day, someone has an idea. Why not build bridges connecting all the islands, so all the islanders can share resources! Soon, wood, food, coal, and hay is moving across the islands, and islanders&#8217; business grows tenfold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, imagine each of those islands is a blockchain. Each blockchain hosts a set of tokenised assets, which had hitherto remained confined to their blockchain. Why not build bridges across the blockchains so assets can be shared, just like the islanders did!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By connecting these different blockchains with different protocols, tokens, and use cases it is possible to serve a wider range of companies and people with different needs and requirements. Every blockchain has a couple of aspects in which it excels, and by connecting these blockchains with each other through cross-chain bridges it is possible to, for example, deploy your application on a blockchain that is highly scalable and supports a lot of transactions, release your token on a mature platform which has a lot of funding available, and to create a bridge with another blockchain which has a specific feature which is useful for your platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An easy solution for all problems?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the above description makes it seem like a solution for a lot of problems companies face when using blockchain technology, this is unfortunately not the reality. Similar to building bridges in the physical world, it takes time and careful planning and preparation in order to build a bridge that can handle all the traffic and ensures the safety of the funds locked up in the bridge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Public) blockchains are very hard to almost impossible to hack as a result of how they are set up, but these bridges do not have the same kind of security. Just last year on Polygon, an Ethereum sidechain that aims to make Ethereum apps more scalable, <a href=\"https://cryptobriefing.com/polygon-swerves-850-million-hack-ethereum-bridge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a critical bug was discovered</a><a href=\"https://cryptobriefing.com/polygon-swerves-850-million-hack-ethereum-bridge/\"> </a>which put $850M at risk. These bridges are a critical, yet relatively weak link in any multi-chain environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the security risks, it is also quite costly to build robust bridges between blockchains. A secure bridge capable of holding millions of dollars worth of funds requires a scalable and decentralised infrastructure in addition to specialised knowledge in order to deploy and maintain it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Building bridges efficiently</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the use cases for these bridges, as well as the challenges that arise when deploying these bridges, are all clear, it makes one wonder if there isn‚Äôt a more efficient solution. Bridges in the real world are built and maintained by teams of specialised engineers, so why shouldn‚Äôt digital bridges be built and maintained by industry experts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zaisan offers a wide range of blockchain solutions, including various <a href=\"https://zaisan.io/solutions/bridge\">cross-chain bridge hosting related services</a>. The benefits of going with a blockchain service provider like Zaisan are numerous and vary depending on the needs of the platform/application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For newcomers to the ecosystem, it provides a simple and cheap entry to the multi-chain world, allowing them to experiment with all the possibilities and opportunities that come with having an application on multiple blockchains. And for industry-leading applications and platforms, it provides a robust and secure bridge that is capable of supporting the multi-chain needs of their specific application or platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the above benefits, it ensures the bridges are built with the highest diligence and standards and are being monitored and maintained around the clock to prevent any unwanted situations. Furthermore, the decentralised infrastructure capable of supporting up to 5 oracles ensures that there is no single point of failure, yet again adding to the robustness and security of the bridge. Besides this, the bridge remains online even if the platform or application goes down. Lastly, more advanced features such as multi-signature backups or frontend development of the bridge can be offered.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The case of Alien Worlds</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now onto the case of Alien Worlds. <a href=\"https://alienworlds.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alien Worlds is one of the biggest blockchain games</a> in the world with thousands of players every day. The game features a wide ecosystem that is powered by their main token, Trilium (TLM).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, Alien Worlds represents a metaverse powered by NFTs. The NFTs inside the Alien Worlds metaverse are used for a variety of features, such as competing in battles, completing quests inside the game, and to mine TLM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TLM can also be used for a variety of features, such as planet governance, in which players get to vote on important decisions on the various Alien World planets, as well as buying in-game items, and staking, which allows users to temporarily lock up their tokens on a specific Alien Worlds planet to get specific rewards. A comprehensive overview of the game and its features can be found <a href=\"https://research.binance.com/en/projects/alien-worlds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://zaisan.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/alien-world-technical-architecture.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://zaisan.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/alien-world-technical-architecture.jpg\" alt=\"Alien Worlds technical architecture\" class=\"wp-image-3537\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Alien Worlds</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the game originated on the WAX blockchain, it quickly took the opportunity to expand to different blockchains for various reasons. The platform itself (and its smart contracts), as well as the majority of the NFTs, and the user accounts run on the WAX blockchain, as the WAX blockchain has free transactions, is very scalable, and has a user-friendly wallet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alien Worlds uses the Ethereum blockchain to run various smart contracts related to their token vesting mechanism, as Ethereum has high amounts of capital available and is commonly associated with DeFi related projects and initiatives. In addition to this, Ethereum has a big community and a wide range of (decentralised) exchanges which Alien Worlds can now access more easily as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, Alien Worlds uses the Binance blockchain to run various smart contracts related to the Token Mission Staking aspect of their games. In addition to this, they use the Binance blockchain to mint NFTs and similarly to Ethereum, to access a new (major) community and a new range of (decentralised) exchanges and applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Alien Worlds Bridge set-up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it is clear what Alien Worlds does it‚Äôs interesting to dive into the specific bridge set-up they use, and some statistics. As described above, Alien Worlds is spread out over 3 different blockchains, namely the WAX, Ethereum, and Binance blockchain. Therefore it is logical that Alien Worlds has a bridge between WAX and Ethereum and WAX and the Binance blockchain. However, there is no bridge between Ethereum and Binance, as most transactions and trading take place on WAX, making such a bridge superfluous.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full lightbox\"><a href=\"https://zaisan.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/alien-worlds-teleport-bridge-service.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://zaisan.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/alien-worlds-teleport-bridge-service.jpg\" alt=\"Alien Worlds Teleport Bridging service\" class=\"wp-image-3536\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Alien Worlds</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to guarantee the uptime and security of these bridges, Alien Worlds uses a decentralised 3 oracle set-up, which makes the bridges incredibly secure and robust, and guarantees a 99.99% uptime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Players can access the Alien Worlds bridges through a front-end on the platform/game itself, where they can conveniently swap their TLM across the various chains. However, using a bridge and fully understanding how it works can still be a challenging task for the average player, which is why the Alien Worlds team has provided <a href=\"https://alienworlds.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500012518322-Teleport-Update-Tokens-Travel-Throughout-the-Metaverse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">comprehensive documentation</a> on how you can use the bridge, frequently asked questions, common issues, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far the Alien Worlds bridges have processed over 100.000 transactions and have millions of dollars worth of Trilium locked up in them in a little less than a year. This proves that the bridges are robust, as well as a core feature of the game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is safe to conclude that cross-chain bridges create a lot of opportunities for a lot of platforms and applications, allowing them to access new communities, technologies, and more. However, deploying and maintaining these bridges can be a tricky and costly task. Blockchain service providers such as Zaisan can help in this regard and <a href=\"https://zaisan.io/solutions/bridge\">provide tailored cross-chain bridge hosting services</a> that suit all platforms, ranging from starters to industry leaders.¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of Alien Worlds, this has allowed them to expand their game to both the Binance and Ethereum blockchain, giving them the opportunity to make their game more interesting and to access an array of blockchain-specific features.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zaisan.io/alien-worlds-cross-chain-bridge/\">Deep Dive into Cross-Chain Bridges and the Case of Alien Worlds</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zaisan.io\">Zaisan</a>.</p>\n",

Why not build bridges across the blockchains so assets can be shared, just like the islanders did!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cross-chain bridges: a simple solution to a big problem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls poster=\"https://zaisan.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/what-is-cross-chain-bridging.jpg\" src=\"https://5261994.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5261994/Video/QandA/Q&amp;A%20with%20Adam%20-%20What%20is%20cross-chain%20bridging.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In computing environments, some terms can be rather obscure and non-descript. Not the case here. A cross-chain bridge does exactly what it says. It is a mechanism to enable the transfer of assets back and forth between two or more chains. Those assets can be tokens, cryptocurrencies, or any other tokenised assets hosted on the chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be wondering what sort of wizardry is this. And furthermore, you might question how can it be possible to move assets between two chains whose protocols, rules, etc. might be completely different? These are valid questions, and here&#8217;s the answer. The bridge acts as a neutral zone (a no man&#8217;s land of sorts) where the switch occurs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An example: two blockchain games, one hosted on an Ethereum chain, the second hosted on WAX. Ethereum uses a proof-of-work consensus protocol, while WAX uses a proof-of-stake one, each with its own set of rules. And each of these games has some cool in-game assets, maps, etc. And each game world features a thriving game economy and has something that the other gaming environment lacks (remember the islanders?) Why not connect the two chains with a bridge and enable asset swapping, so that both gaming worlds (and their in-game economies) expand and grow?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exponential growth for GameFi and DeFi environments</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain has yielded much disruption and innovation throughout its relatively short lifespan, and the <a href=\"https://zaisan.io/alien-worlds-cross-chain-bridge/\">future</a> looks just as innovative and bright.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some time now, this technology has been associated with decentralised finance (DeFi). That is, the provision of financial instruments without reliance on centralised intermediaries, such as banks, credit unions, or brokerages. The marriage between blockchain and DeFi has been a successful one.<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">According to Statista</a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/\">,</a> there&#8217;s currently billions held in DeFi environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in more recent times, blockchain is spreading its area of influence to gaming in the form of game finance (GameFi), a relatively new concept that combines cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other tokenised assets to create a gaming environment where players can play, trade, and earn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mechanics underlying GameFi are relatively simple. <a href=\"https://zaisan.io/nft-games-tokenising-game-digital-assets/\">In-game assets are distributed in NFT form</a>, which guarantees ownership. This is key, as it enables the players to trade these assets as they see fit, sell them to other players, etc. And this is where cross-chain bridges come in. These two-way paths enable these assets to be moved from one chain to another. By doing this, the player pool grows exponentially, as players can participate in multiple gaming environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same applies to DeFi environments, albeit without the gaming part. Users of different blockchains can have their assets exchanged on the bridge so they can be used on another blockchain. This is sometimes called &#8216;cross-chain swap.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of multi-chain bridging are clear. The islanders knew it, and now you know too. Scalability, portability, and a massively expanded user or player pool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cross-chain bridging with Zaisan</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zaisan is a multi-discipline blockchain services provider, including<a href=\"https://zaisan.io/solutions/bridge\"> cross-chain bridging hosting</a>.

    "pub_date": "Mon, 26 Sep 2022 08:06:57 +0000",
    "encoded_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web3 games have recently gained pace with several <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a href=\"https://algobitz.com/gamefi-101-how-to-enhance-your-gaming-experience-while-making-money/\">GameFi</a></strong></span> projects going live on daily basis. The ongoing situation is a good opportunity to observe and re-evaluate the essence of Web3 gaming. For quite some time, we‚Äôve analyzed many well-established gaming companies launching fabulous projects on Web3, in parallel to new companies entering the Web3 ecosystem with their infant yet amazing projects, and unfortunately, we found one thing in common. Although almost all of their whitepapers included and highlighted sustainability as one of their main objectives, their workaround was primarily based on getting a massive return on their investment as early, after the game goes live, as possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, this way of thinking poses threat to the reliability of many good game prospects for the long and even mid-level term. The volatility of most cryptocurrencies on which GameFi depends creates a major obstacle to the sustainability of Web3 games. Due to the main driving force for engaging in Web3 games is to earn or trade in cryptocurrencies, there has been a lot of dependency on the volatile crypto market, which is uncontrollable for gamers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As soon as the market dips, we observed a dip in user engagement in Web3 games. As a result, many companies who are self-funded or looking forward to upcoming funding round, face negative consequences. These instances also prove that long-term goals of designing a good game economy, may also not be worthy of putting effort, due to such an underlying system crumbling the sustainability of the game. The fact that the focus of a major section of players is on the value of their digital assets in a game puts up two concerns:¬†</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is a sudden impact on the Web3 ecosystem, would that start a panic amongst those players and eventually initiates an exodus from the game?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the game&#8217;s digital assets can only be traded in a particular cryptocurrency, then what would keep those players engaged in the game if its value drops at a certain point?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These issues act as catalysts for speculation, and in time they give a higher but unsustainable, investment return to the players. Practically, you can‚Äôt eliminate them from any game because that will be a blow to the major attraction for the players to try a Web3 game and stay in its environment. Till the time this strategy is working well, only those games that compromise on sustainability against growth will flourish.</span></p>\n<h2><b>How can Web3 Games become sustainable?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suppose the primary ground for gamers to be in the game is the speculative value of their digital assets. In that case, no matter how well-fabricated the in-game economy is, the game will not be sustainable. The establishment of sustainability in a gaming environment can only be achieved if the driving force of players changes from &#8216;this is a game where you play to make money&#8217; to &#8216;this is a game with great gameplay experience, you play to have fun, and you *can* also earn or get rewarded through that for your time and efforts&#8217;. If players come to the game with such an objective, then they won‚Äôt flee the game in the case of a drop in their digital asset value. Certain ways could help achieve these objectives, and hence sustainability, however, they all have their own challenges.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Proper Utilization of Early Investment</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we need to understand is that early players in a game are not particularly aiming at the gameplay, they are actually looking to crowdfund the game developers for the growth of the game. Since the early players are actually the investors, they expect the game to be established to attract more players who will be spending money to supply profits to the early investors. Hence, most games have a framework to sell securities with utility elements, like virtual real estate that will provide passive income to the holders based on the activity performed on them by players; as well as Initial Coin Offerings and NFT presales where buyers expect to sell those assets later. This framework has some clear problems:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of actual investor ideology to commit towards the growth of the game, this thinking encourages malpractices like building false hype, rug pull schemes, etc. taking unfair advantage of the absence of governance.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the target is increasing the profit on their digital assets, these early investors may leave the game if the value of their assets decreases or if the game economy crumbles.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The in-game assets should be designed around utility and must maintain their value, which creates an obstacle to bringing in new content which is a mandate for long-term sustainability.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h3><b>User Generated Content</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are parallel spaces of content creators (the Earners who actually create reasons to spend on the game) and content consumers (the Spenders who spend and generate revenue for the game) in the gaming world, and blockchain technology maintains a symbiosis of transactions between them. A healthy balance between the two components is extremely necessary to incorporate sustainability into the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nowadays, a player can grind a digital asset in a game and trade it with any player in another game. This activity does not supply any value in the former game, because it does not give any motivation to the existing players to spend more in that game. All such grounds for players to spend in the game are already integrated by game developers in its design, however, the activities of grinding the resources and assets of a game degrade those grounds.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What is next for the </b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://algobitz.com/metaverse-gaming/\">Web3 gaming</a></span><b> space?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, the major disadvantage for all such strategies to implement sustainability in Web3 games is that the community which engages in these games mostly comprises players who are actually involved in the blockchain domain and not the prospects who can transition from Web2 to Web3 gaming. Web3 gaming currently fuels the motivation of earning and getting high returns on early investment for the players, due to which they would naturally give precedence to short-term accomplishments over the legitimate fundamentals of sustainable growth of the gaming environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web3 games are stuck in a deadlock where, on one hand, players think that blockchain gaming is volatile in nature and it is best to hit the jackpot as soon as possible in a game and then move on to the next game, and on the other hand, this practice is maintaining the volatility of the blockchain gaming ecosystem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the Web3 games include the same defects; they grow on the same strategy and quickly wrap up after gaining profit, and successive games keep this cycle going on and on. In rare instances, some games tried to break this cycle through innovative measures for creating sustainability, however, they faced backlash and their efforts went in vain. One such example was Axie Infinity, once a crowned jewel of Web3 games, where the daily revenue sunk from approximately $8M to scarcely $10k, along with a nosedive of active accounts from 1M to 50k only. And the reason? It was a change in the strategy of its game economy to attain sustainability, that directly hit the game speculation and provoked mass abandonment of players.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We try to drop the veil for the global gaming community through our analysis and hope that players and investors will notice the negative experiences of Web3 games and dig down to find the reasons for their downfall that suddenly happened after the uprising. We expect them not to just focus on short-term growth and profits but evolve their strategies to stimulate sustainability in the Web3 games.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://algobitz.com/why-web3-games-should-focus-on-sustainability/\">Why Web3 games should focus on Sustainability?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://algobitz.com\">Algobitz</a>.</p>\n",

    "encoded_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Web3 revolution, and Web3 gaming is the next kid on the block. Web3 games are open-source online games that use blockchain technology as an underlying pillar of a game‚Äôs economy. Web gaming has a value-exchange model for gaming so that gamers can own and trade in-game assets and collectibles via unique NFTs, using game tokens or cryptocurrencies. The characteristic of the play-to-earn Web3 game economics that a player can own in-game assets draws a sheer contrast to traditional game economies, which were majorly based on a closed environment, restricting gamers from buying or selling in-game earnings for real-world value.¬†</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web3 gaming has been so far successful in providing self-sovereignty and decentralization in gaming. There are many names by which Web3 games are being adapted and promoted by gaming communities, like Play-to-Earn games, Crypto games, NFT games, etc. The assets inside the game are tangibly owned by the players as NFTs and liquid markets are established for trading these assets. Neither any central authority has governance on the Web3 gaming ecosystem, nor on the ownership of in-game assets and gameplay experiences. The players, or Gaming DAOs, manage the governance inside a Web3 game and the players have sole ownership over their earnings in this decentralized environment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let us go through some fundamental features of Web3 gaming platforms:</span></p>\n<h3><b>Ownership and interoperability</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While playing traditional games, players tend to lose all of their in-game assets once they decide to change the game or the gaming platform. Moreover, there was no real-world value to their digital assets. Whereas in Web3 gaming, gamers completely own their in-game assets and collectibles in the form of NFTs, which they earn through their time and efforts inside the game. This feature wraps around the concept of self-sovereignty by giving players the true ownership and interoperability of sharing their in-game digital assets across multiple platforms. That simply means that any gamer can own in-game assets on one platform and take them over to the next Web3 gaming platform of his choice, without losing their significance and value.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Integrating Traditional Games</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gaming experience is quite personalized in nature, as every gamer has his/her preferences on games, genre, characters, etc. and Web3 brings in the feature to integrate the upgraded model of old yet loved games into the metaverse and blockchain platforms, incorporating decentralization in its core to expand the domain of what players can actually do in the game. With old games mutated on the Web3 framework and running in the metaverse, players can now create their avatars there and start trading their favorite in-game collectibles and digital assets in marketplaces and take advantage of earning in cryptocurrencies or game tokens.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Player-driven Game Economics</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blending the cryptocurrencies in gaming by the Play-to-Earn model of Web3 gaming makes the gaming economies more approachable, empowering the players to engage in P2E economics. The native integration between traditional MMO (Massive Multiplayer Online) game economics and P2E economics (which includes virtual assets, economic techniques and player coordination models) opens up a proper distribution framework for players. This will help in aligning incentives for gamers and game developers, along with establishing true ownership of digital assets and advancement in the game.</span></p>\n<h4><b>WEB3 games negligible downtime</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web3 gaming has been able to be highly scalable and take full advantage of the attributes of decentralization, like block minting, very low maintenance cost, high data storage availability and no involvement of any centralized authority for governance, to execute autonomously and give negligible downtime to its users.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Transparency in gaming</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an established distributed framework, Web3 games are hosted on the unhackable blockchain network, thus heightening the security of the model. Another feature of blockchain technology, that is utilized in Web3 games, is DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) which merges a high level of transparency in this model. DAOs provide the voting consensus for any modification in the game and this voting consensus can be impartially accessed by any player of the game community.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Closing Thoughts on WEB3 gaming</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prospects of Web3 gaming look encouraging in 2022 as more and more P2E games and metaverses are going live on the blockchain platform on an everyday basis. It is expected that the metaverse market will touch $800B by 2024, as this expanding virtual world and its P2E model is onboarding new users continuously in its ecosystem. As the Web3 gaming industry evolves, the demand for a massive amount of digital infrastructure and Metaverse development expertise is rising constantly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We, at Algobitz, have recently established the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">center of excellence for Web 3.0 gaming which will bring a paradigm shift in our mission to offer </span><b>world-class Gaming solutions, animation, design and Blockchain tech</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Global Gaming studios.

    "encoded_content": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inflation regulation, strongest tokenomics, perfect user interface, etc are those factors that any P2E game should keep in check when aiming for long-term sustainability in evergrowing WEB3 space.¬†</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that currenty there are around 300 well-established Play-to-Earn games in the market and numerous are being built daily. With billions of gamers in the global Web3 community, any new game targets to welcome a tide of gamers to bloom in the market, but a tsunami of incoming gamers sinks the economy of any game.¬†</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let‚Äôs discuss a systematic approach toward achieving this equilibrium in any game project.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Balancing the Players in the Game:</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good number of players is a basic requirement for any game project to uphold in the market. Whether it is a newly launched game or any already-established game, if it does not get a sufficient number of players at any point in time, it will collapse. Many game companies assume that if they make their game free to play, they will attract a large number of players to their game, and this may work for many games, however, this approach is not feasible for the <a href=\"https://algobitz.com/play-to-earn-gaming/\">Play-to-Earn</a> model. Since the most attractive feature of P2E gaming is trading in-game rewards like NFTs, tokens, etc., on blockchain platforms, a large number of players sharing the same motive would bring out aggressive inflation in the game economy, and ultimately it will fall to pieces.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One may think that we can restrict the rewards for free players and that should do. However, when thousands of free players create inflation on those restricted rewards, that would sum up to be catastrophic for the game economy. Moreover, the existence of bots that squeeze out the resources of a game, is another critical issue. When the negligible impact of each bot on the game resources accumulates with the impacts of thousands of bots, it crumbles down the game economy at once. Another common misconception is to let players enter the game for free but not allow them to get any rewards, but that is faulty from the core because this concept would be the replica of traditional pay-to-play games where profit is the priority and gameplay for free players is compromised.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Resolution</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some brilliant minds of <a href=\"https://algobitz.com/nft-games-create-serious-hype-among-developers-with-advent-of-web-3/\">GameFi</a> and the Play-to-Earn domain have come up with key alterations in the P2E model, which would shield the game economy from the negative impact of having too many players. There has been a slight change in the framework according to which the free players would get unrestricted access to the game but restricted ability to trade in-game assets to the blockchain market. The revised structure would not impact the incoming flow of gamers in the game but would create a safeguard against the negative impacts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few games, like BattleMancers, allow free players to enter the game and earn rewards, just like any player with an initial investment in the game (premium player) would get, but either they‚Äôre unable to trade outside the game, or they‚Äôd need to transact with the premium players or buy something from the game backend, to enable the trade of their assets outside the game. As a result, the gameplay is not compromised at all; both free and premium players stay competitive and have fun, however, the final motive of taking in-game assets on the global blockchain market to trade, requires the free players to compensate the premium players or the game developers in some way or the other.</span></p>\n<h2><b>An Experience of Being Recognized</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A majority of Web3 gaming projects are focused on making profits. They try to sell as many assets, NFTs, or tokens as possible before and after the game launch because they have short-term objectives for their game. Their game is not intended to create an unforgettable gameplay experience for the players, but to extract maximum profit in the first phase of the game itself. This immense drive designed by the game company causes inflation in the game economy. The players, who took the bait and invested in the initial phase of the game, found shrinking returns and reduced prices of their investment amount. These players invested with the thought of being recognized in the next phases of the game, which is a core driving need for any player. Now, what happens is that such a practice disturbs the trust of the community and the few authentic projects face the after-effects.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Resolution: </b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of selling any tokens or assets, they should be supplied as rewards. Premium trading features, like NFT minting, etc. can be limited to initial investors only, whereas the gameplay is identical for everyone. Through this strategy, the initial investors will receive the profit, not the game developers. The demand for tokens can be supplied by the initial investors of the game, who will earn the token through staking or P2E, without any need for venture capital, private investors, or launchpad presales.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion: dominance against inflation</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is essential to establish mechanisms for controlling inflation in the rewards of a P2E game, as losing the value of in-game assets hampers the income potential of the initial investors. The dominance against inflation can also be achieved by controlling the number of player profiles that can mint their assets. While some NFT owners prefer staking for earning tokens, others prefer renting. A segment of NFT owners may prefer listing their NFTs on platforms like Opensea, while other segments may either prefer spending their NFTs in the game for upgrading their gameplay experience or hold them as collectibles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any game based on the P2E model can sustain only if a small number of players are engaged to trade their rewards. When the bulk population of the game engages in selling their in-game assets, then it‚Äôs the onset of failure for the game economy because this very activity directly exploits the major premise of the game, i.e. gameplay and fun.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://algobitz.com/inflation-and-its-regulation-in-p2e-model/\">Inflation and its regulation in P2E Model</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://algobitz.com\">Algobitz</a>.</p>\n",

    "encoded_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scams in Gamefi increase as the subsector notes meteoric growth. The blockchain gaming industry is one of the most prominent players in the market and its prospects have never declined. </span>With the advent of blockchain-based decentralized gaming,the gaming sector started its development towards a new phase. The recent tide of new games has created a new revolution in the global community. Blockchain gaming and the incorporation of NFTs have been earnestly fascinating new players to involve in the development process, besides enjoying their favorite gameplays.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the volatility of the crypto market, GameFi has constantly stepped up and the price of its tokens is routinely increasing because of its NFT element. Investors nowadays are not attending to the need to improve the game mechanics. They are rather focused on earning profit out of reselling the in-game assets. So, analyze the marketing and technological peripheral of a project, along with the advantage its token. But this is the point where you might get tricked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the crowd of blockchain-based projects, there is a high probability of every random one being dishonest with its offerings. One needs to be wary about the alluring promises from any <a href=\"https://algobitz.com/gamefi-development/\">GameFi</a> project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s have a look at how can we avoid such scams in gamefi and the simple strategy to identify them.</span></p>\n<h2><b>How to spot a scam?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is observed that NFT games are generally wide-reaching but heavily planned on accomplishing their purpose to ransack the community. They target such investors who are not experts but novices, so they can tempt amateur investors with mesmerizing commercials. Hence, before putting the money into any project, one must be aware of the probabilities of such a trap and be wary in the following ways:</span><b></b></p>\n<h3><b>1. Their Team:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If someone is presenting his new project in the global market, he must be someone with stockpiled knowledge and experience. Their genuine and detailed information on Internet, along with their track record of career, gives an adequate amount of reliability factor. On the other hand, when a new project&#8217;s team stays anonymous, then that is a sign of something shady. It happens regardless of the scale on which it is launched and being promoted in the market.</span><b></b></p>\n<h3><b>2. Their social network:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quick look and analysis of the social network is asking the community to invest in the prospects of incredible success in the future. It will give you a strong hunch on its credibility. You must look out for the bunch of people following them, along with the essence of their responses in the community. This elaborates whether the community is vulnerable to being mass-scammed, or experts are involved with expert project analysis.¬†</span><b></b></p>\n<h3><b>3. Smart contract:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With any of the easily-available online amenities, like Etherscan, BscScan, etc. you can go through the smart contracts incorporated in the project to get detailed data on the time when the project was formed, launched in the market, its users, and information on its tokens. You can check or get them checked in any community of experts, to make a calculated assessment of investing in that project.</span><b></b></p>\n<h3><b>4. Network marketing:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) is a popular system on which a good deal of GameFi projects are framed. MLM has constantly been successful in drawing the interest of new users in the projects it has been involved in. However, MLM is the project‚Äôs only source of revenue and still they are promising huge profits to its users. Without any concrete value-added channels and structures for investors&#8217; profits, the project might be a big scam.¬†</span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion: Beware of the scams in gamefi</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is imperative to highlight that maximum projects often start with just a white paper, an attractive website, and a token listing on a crypto exchange. Fictional employees and fake partnerships are common traps to mislead new investors. One must also try to engage in the gameplay, because if the game is not real then it might seem as a rug-pull scheme.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algobitz provides blockchain expertise, domain knowledge and GTM strategies to start-ups looking to launch a hybrid crypto exchange.

    "encoded_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As all of us are well aware of what GameFi is. It refers to a mix of the most recent crypto innovations with the traditional pleasure of winning rewards. Players on GameFi can lend, trade, or even rent out their earnings. Even though traditional games encourage players to collect and exchange digital assets, the value of these objects allows trading real-world money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since GameFi has become such a well-known phenomenon, certain trends are emerging in GameFi that will keep you on your feet are:¬†</span></p>\n<h3><b>1. The Metaverse and NFTs</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NFTs are likely to become GameFi&#8217;s economic backbone. There is an irrevocable relationship between both in-game sales and the unique digital ownership rights provided by NFTs. The emergence of metaverse start-ups and finance has resulted in a three-way interdependence supporting each other. Virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) devices are used in metaverse games to build immersive 3D settings where players may transact.¬†</span></p>\n<h3><b>2. More Investors</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With GameFi grabbing and maintaining interest, it appears that compelling and sophisticated games will be developed, attracting a larger number of backers and investors to the DeFi sector. Another prominent franchise that has landed a narrative in <a href=\"https://www.sandbox.game/en/\"><strong>The Sandbox</strong></a>, where gamers will be able to enter a simulated zombie world, is The Walking Dead. The world seems to be liking the integration of Crypto, Gaming and NFT world, but there is no doubt in saying that GameFi space is ready to explode in the coming future.</span></p>\n<h3><b>3. Cloud Gaming gaining Popularity</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud gaming refers to the process of playing video games on servers located remotely in data centres. On a PC or console, there is no need to download and install games. Instead, to transmit gaming data to an app or browser downloaded on the remote host, streamers require a steady internet connection. The game is processed and played on a distant server, yet everything is visible with interactions on your device. It&#8217;s the same as Netflix or any other streaming service. The only exception is that the server providing the video stream may also monitor and respond to your inputs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to its various benefits and cost redundancy, cloud gaming is an excellent choice. It has been emerging and will reach heights in the coming future. The fundamental feature that makes cloud gaming appealing to those looking to migrate from traditional gaming is cross-platform syncing.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of blockchain-based gaming dApps is growing at a significant rate. These tendencies, taken together, point to an ecosystem that is rapidly evolving and improving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, GameFi and blockchain gaming will have a promising future in the coming years. Many new blockchain games will be released, and there is a largely untapped market of gamers who might switch from traditional games to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://algobitz.com/play-to-earn-gaming/\"><strong>blockchain games</strong></a></span>.¬†</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://algobitz.com/emerging-trends-in-gamefi/\">Emerging Trends in GameFi</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://algobitz.com\">Algobitz</a>.</p>\n",

It generates a better way of income opportunities every day for its users, without compromising on their desire to play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the distributed ledger of blockchain, crypto games make their players verified owners of digital assets for income generation.

    "encoded_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain gaming or gamefi is one of the most talked-about things in the crypto world, and it&#8217;s rising in popularity and use. GameFi means making money out of the gaming experience. It is a mix of the words &#8220;game&#8221; and &#8220;finance.&#8221; Of course, generating money playing online games is nothing new, but with the debut of GameFi, gamers have access to an abundance of new prospects thanks to blockchain technology and decentralized financing (DeFi).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GameFi&#8217;s origins date back to 2013, when bitcoin was not as widespread as it is now, but game developers had already begun to adopt it into their productions. For example, the game Bombermine. However, the GameFi sector grew slowly until 2021, when it made a breakthrough. The introduction of NFT and DeFi was the reason.¬†</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By 2020, GameFi projects started showing up on the crypto market in the form that we know them now ‚Äî blockchain games in which users may earn tokens and in-game digital assets that can be sold on the resale market in addition to entertainment and collecting in-game objects. The <a href=\"https://algobitz.com/web3-gaming-key-features/\">GameFi</a> sphere has a multi-million dollar fanbase thanks to this concept, which is growing steadily.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The summer of 2021 is known as the &#8220;summer of NFT&#8221; or gamification as multiple cryptocurrency blockchain games witnessed a significant spike in the value of their tokens. Consider the Axie Infinity fever, which was followed by an AXS token surge. This Ethereum-based gaming platform once generated above $ 800 million in revenue in 30 days, making it the frontrunner in this indication among all DeFi protocols.</span></p>\n<h2><b>The future of blockchain gaming</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <a href=\"http://naavik.co/digest/industry-china\">Naavik</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bitkraft.vc/gaming-industry-market-size/\">BITKRAFT</a> Ventures, the blockchain gaming market will increase at a 100% CAGR from $1.5 billion in 2021 to $50 billion in 2025. It is ten times the traditional gaming industry&#8217;s predicted CAGR i.e. 10%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The distinctions between GameFi and traditional gaming could become further blurred depending on how traditional gaming companies implement blockchain technology. For example, ATRI (by video game developer Atari), Netmarble, and WEMIX have all launched or are planning to issue their crypto coins (by South Korean gaming company WeMade).¬†</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GameFi&#8217;s fair value and the number of users are expected to skyrocket. Overall, GameFi and blockchain gaming will have a bright future soon. Many new blockchain games will be released, and there is a largely untapped market of gamers who might potentially migrate from traditional games to blockchain games.¬†</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://algobitz.com/blockchain-gaming-sector-aka-gamefi-posts-rapid-growth/\">Blockchain Gaming Sector aka GameFi posts rapid growth</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://algobitz.com\">Algobitz</a>.</p>\n",

    "encoded_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investment in traditional assets is left far behind, it is the era of blockchain investment now. GameFi and play-to-earn (P2E) projects and protocols have been rapidly growing in leaps and bounds. These demonstrates significant advantages over conventional gaming and providing players with the unique potential to experience the benefits of their involvement.¬†</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GameFi incorporates features from developing blockchain sectors such as DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized gaming. This technology enables an individual to perceive in-depth knowledge of traditional gaming. NFTs, for example, have long been an integral part of GameFi, mostly functioning as in-game characters or assets. GameFi is dictating the crypto universe these days, handling billions of dollars each year. Apart from technologically reinventing the game industry, it is also positioning itself as a tremendously valuable investment opportunity.</span></p>\n<p><strong>How to choose a <a href=\"https://algobitz.com/gamefi-development/\">Gamefi</a> project from investment perspective?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a question, the most essential feature to look for in crypto-based projects is security. Only invest through well-known and reliable launchpads after verifying the credibility of the initiative&#8217;s social media. Choosing a promising and trustworthy IDO (a source of gaining funds from retail investors) project is the first step towards a profitable investment venture. Unfortunately, some fraudulent projects continue to exist to defraud investors, so keep an eye out for them.¬†</span></p>\n<p><strong>What are some emerging GameFi Projects?</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>1. GamesPad</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eran Elhanani and Constantin Kogan originally established <a href=\"https://gamespad.io/\">GamesPad</a> &#8211; serial business owners, and digital asset investors with a solid track record. The team is launching the next-generation gaming platform, which will bring together three of the most profitable industries: gaming, NFT, and the metaverse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was founded by Eran Elhanani and Constantin Kogan, digital asset investors and speakers. They are building the next-generation gaming platform that brings together three of the most lucrative fields: gaming, nanotechnology, and the metaverse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project will try to appeal to retail investors by providing timely access and the option to invest, along with VCs in the best crypto gaming projects. It will serve as a one-stop-shop for all gaming, NFT, and DeFi necessities. Young founders and initiatives will be supported by the platform, which will provide full development, mentorship, and network connections in the space. GamesPad is going to be the next big thing in the GameFi and Crypto universe. It should definitely be considered as an anticipated project to invest in.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>2. NTVRK</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.netvrk.co/\">NTVRK</a> is a blockchain-based social VR platform that enables users to create, share, and commercialize their creations. While it is uncertain how this infrastructure will operate under stress, it does present some intriguing possibilities. Exploring the infrastructure that will support current and future GameFi projects is always a good idea. NTVRK has a market valuation of less than $80 million, despite a 37.1 % weekly price increase.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>3. Pegaxy Stone (PGX)</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://pegaxy.io/\">Pegaxy Stone</a> blockchain retains a dual token structure. To finish in the top three of all races, players must combine skill with strategy and deal with the game&#8217;s distinct elements. The project has a valuation of about $38 million because it is a GameFi venture with features of rental, production, and trading.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Gamefi presents good investment opportunities¬†</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaming has emerged to be one of the finest, if not the best, applications of blockchain technology. With the rise of NFTs and the metaverse, <a href=\"https://algobitz.com/nft-games-create-serious-hype-among-developers-with-advent-of-web-3/\">blockchain gaming</a> makes a fair investment option for users while also having fun.

    "encoded_content": "<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With the advent of new technology, gaming has grown to become one of the most lucrative entertainment industries in the world. If we were to track the history of gaming, the Pay 2 Win model of gaming has been largely considered the only player in the race. But, the advancements in technology have given birth to newer and more accessible forms of gaming.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The new era of gaming has proved how sometimes bringing two industries together can revolutionize the traditional ways of doing things. The most prominent example of this would be the combination of gaming and finance, usually referred to as¬†</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">GameFi</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">.¬†</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is GameFi?</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">GameFi can be defined as decentralized applications (dapps) with economic incentives. While playing a game, tokens are typically awarded as prizes for undertaking game-related activities such as fighting matches, or producing digital crops. It is also known as the &#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; approach.¬†</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How does GameFi Work?</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The only parties that profited from the digital currency that was sold to players or users till now were the game developers because these assets had no actual significance. However, the power structure is changing owing to the popularity of crypto games. While traditional games have always been primarily about enjoyment, crypto games combine entertainment with the prospect of earning actual money.¬†</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When a player purchases an asset, they are adding to the game&#8217;s economic worth. Axie Infinity, CropBytes, and Gods Unchained are some renowned crypto games that allow players to earn money by performing in-game objectives.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How the Combination of Finance and Gaming will affect the Future</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Adding to the earning aspect of GameFi, there are several other incentives to becoming a part of the GameFi community:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Players can establish ownership of in-game assets.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Its decentralized nature ensures that no single figure is in terms of setting reckless administrative decisions.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Players cannot lose or discard any of the materials they earn during the game.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The idea of Finance and Gaming is revolutionary. If one can earn digitally by playing games, then we say that there is a scope for anything. If GameFi takes off, the future generation will reap its benefits the most. With more mainstream businesses embracing the metaverse and GameFi, this space has tremendous potential for growth.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The GameFi industry will continue to transform the existing financial sector, resulting in a new digital economy. In-game money brings endless possibilities for reaping incentives for simple tasks like finishing game stages and buying and selling avatars. The GameFi industry will continue to develop in the future, facilitating the creation of complete-game meta universes.¬†</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://algobitz.com/impact-of-combining-gaming-and-finance-on-the-future-generation/\">Impact of Combining Gaming and Finance On the Future Generation</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://algobitz.com\">Algobitz</a>.</p>\n",

    "encoded_content": "<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies, and the scope of the crypto market, which is substantial enough for people to make millions off of it, will inevitably draw those with malicious motives. Based on the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, immoral behaviours are familiar to consumers, and a pump and dump is just another avenue for malevolent operators to scam gullible investors out of their hard-earned money. The other party will &#8216;pump&#8217; the market by buying considerable amounts of low-priced cryptocurrencies to unfairly boost the price of their trading platform once the newest member user puts their money. The platforms will also make it appear as if the user has access to special, secret, and highly effective trading methods, but these claims are obvious lies meant to attract the user into the scheme.¬†</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Defi-Gamefi.com is a website that helps individuals learn how to make money in the metaverse via gaming. Recently it warned new and novice traders about a type of crypto scam known as a &#8220;Pump and Dump.&#8221;¬†</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Raul Meza, a writer for Defi-Gamefi.com, covers pump and dump schemes in the video. Pump and dump schemes feature fraudulent internet trading platforms having limited access or are difficult to reach through normal channels. To &#8216;join the program&#8217; or to be a share of the &#8216;pool,&#8217; new traders who are offered tailored promotions for the sites must deposit a specific sum of money.¬†</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One major tactic to recognize unscrupulous traders is to look at their estimates for the whole crypto market and, as a result, claims for how much money people who utilize the trading platform stand to profit. The cryptocurrency market is extremely fickle, and major international events usually cause significant variations in the market capitalizations of major cryptocurrencies. Anyone claiming to be an expert on the matter is almost certainly looking to offload something to anyone who would hear them.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The article goes on to give recommendations to anyone willing to participate in the crypto sector on how to spot and escape pump and dump scams. According to the report, one of the most telling indications that an investor is visiting a dubious trading site is if they are encouraged to take a survey or questionnaire on the platform. Questionnaires are a deceptive approach to making the platform feel trustworthy.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Finally, the post warns users not to divulge their personal information such as their name, email address, phone number, password, or any other information that can be traced back to them. If an investor is solicited by a pump and dump scam, they can report the occurrence to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the Federal Trade Commission right away (FTC).</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">¬†According to the article, any promises of constant income and profits should be treated with a dose of scepticism since they are hoaxes meant to tempt traders misled by the allure of making quick cash, much like most things in life that are too good to be true.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://algobitz.com/pump-and-dump-in-gamefi/\">Pump and Dump in GameFi</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://algobitz.com\">Algobitz</a>.</p>\n",

    "encoded_content": "<p>One of the aspects of My Neighbor Alice&#8217;s vision that fascinates players the most is that it is an entrepreneurial sandbox. The game&#8217;s economy is governed by the players, and their interactions generate a thriving economy full with opportunities. Beginners with a little budget can take use of these options, as well as advanced users with a large budget. Here are some examples of how you can start your own business in MNA:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Farming (or employing others to farm your property for you) is a good way to get money.<br>All farming takes place on land parcels that are represented by NFTs purchased through lotteries. You can cultivate crops on your land and sell them to other people if you&#8217;re one of the lucky ones who managed to get any! Planting and cultivating crops is a delightful hobby in and of itself ‚Äì just remember to water them! If all of that effort is too much for you, you can just rent out your land to another person and profit from the rental income.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Rich and beautiful islands of The Lummelunda Archipelago <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3dd.png\" alt=\"üèù\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MyNeighborAlice?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MyNeighborAlice</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cute?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cute</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/thoMAwmj4p\">pic.twitter.com/thoMAwmj4p</a></p>&mdash; Alice (@MyNeighborAlice) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MyNeighborAlice/status/1456285449224327172?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 4, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recognizing your animals&#8217; powers<br></strong>Animals are unique NFTs that found new homes earlier this year at our first farm animal adoption event, with additional animal adoption events planned in the future. Animals have the ability to make new objects out of different materials. These created resources are normally more valuable in trade, and they can even be used to create one-of-a-kind goods. Every animal has its own unique crafting ability, some of which are more rare than others. When you harvest organic cotton from your property, for example, some animals will assist you in spinning the cotton into a thread. Other animals can weave the thread into fabric, and special creatures can dye the fabric in the colors you choose. You may either sell these materials or use them to create your own unique clothing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"850\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3006\" srcset=\"https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download-1.png 850w, https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download-1-300x125.png 300w, https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download-1-770x321.png 770w, https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download-1-293x122.png 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>completing tasks that have been assigned by other players<br></strong>If you do not yet own any property or animals, you may be able to earn your first money by working for landowners. They may require your assistance in tending to their crops or caring for their animals. Lands require watering and care, while animals want food, water, and a lot of love and attention! Lands that are well-kept produce greater harvests, and animals that are well-kept are significantly better at crafting, making your assistance useful to a landowner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Arbitrage of resources<br></strong>Traveling across the many players&#8217; territories is a wonderful voyage in and of itself; you&#8217;ll meet new individuals and see their creations, farms, animals, and furniture. If you&#8217;re lucky, you might find that certain materials are less expensive in one location than in another. These characteristics allow you to play the role of a trader, buying and selling products all across the world for a profit!<br>Rental and ownership of animals<br>You might want to enter into the realm of animal ownership if you&#8217;ve made enough money doing jobs or as a traveling merchant. Animals can be owned in MNA, and they can reside on land that you rent from another player. You can now create and sell your own resources on the market. You can also outsource your animals&#8217; talents to other players when you are not utilizing them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Creating and designing one-of-a-kind things and outfits<br></strong>You can get a decent price by trading commodities, but do you know what gets you an even better deal? Making something special! You may find yourself constructing fashionable sweaters, swift shoes, attractive outfits, and a plethora of hats as you progress through the many stages of animal crafting. These are all one-of-a-kind goods that gamers can wear to show off their individual style. The more distinctive and fascinating a design is, the higher the market price it can command! Because each piece of apparel you make is a one-of-a-kind NFT, you can exchange it with other players.<br>As you can see, our game world is set up to provide players with a variety of methods to profit from their work. As one of Alice&#8217;s new neighbors, how will you build your fortune?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sign up to our Newsletter below to get insight from industry leaders and forecasts</h3>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://metaversenewscom.substack.com/embed\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\" style=\"border:1px solid #EEE; background:white;\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow Metaverse News anywhere we publish,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Metaversenewsgo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/metaversenewsworld/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a></p><p>The post <a href=\"https://metaversenews.com/my-neighbor-alices-in-game-economy/\">My Neighbor Alice‚Äôs in-game Economy</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://metaversenews.com\">Metaverse News</a>.</p>",

    "encoded_content": "<p>Throughout its growth, the internet has influenced every area of our lives. Web 2.0, for example, has opened up new worldwide financial innovation opportunities. Gig economies have been a major contributor. Everything from cab booking to home massages to freelance work prospects is now available with a simple click. So much so that by 2023, the gig economy will be worth $455 billion. Web 2.0 continues to hire people with varied skill sets and expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, web 3.0 is swiftly advancing the internet towards the next era of innovation. As a result, things like gaming as a career are no longer unthinkable for most people. The gaming business is huge in the realm of entertainment and has been for a long time. Traditional games are currently valued at $178 billion and are anticipated to reach $268 billion by 2025. Web 3.0 has the ability to drastically revolutionize the interaction between gamers, games, and game makers, among other markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain, cryptography, and tokenization advances are vital in this area. Web 3.0 promotes new economic opportunities, decentralization, and community building. The booming blockchain-cryptocurrency business, with a market valuation of over $2.5 trillion, helps it do this. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a product of this sector, and they have huge significance and scope in digital gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Game worlds are no longer assemblages of immaterial warriors, weaponry, racing vehicles, or anything. A potential economic alternative, especially in economies free of traditional finance&#8217;s excesses, is gaming finance (GameFi). Southeast Asia has established itself as a breeding ground for GameFi ecosystems, which is very important for global economic landscape. But why is this location ideal for GameFi?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GameFi&#8217;s calming influence on uncertainty, inflation, and corruption Southeast Asian economies are typically weak, falling to the dollar, pound, or other first-world currency supremacy. It is also common to see high inflation in these countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Covid-19-induced global economic shutdowns have compounded the issue. Over 81 million individuals lost work in Asia-Pacific in the last two years. Worse, there is extreme financial disparity. In Thailand, for example, 1% of the population controls almost 58 percent of the nation&#8217;s wealth and resources. Plus, the ASEAN area has the worst corruption perception index ratings in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the region&#8217;s poor communities seek new livelihoods and economic models. GameFi has an answer, especially post-pandemic. Play-to-earn (P2E) games rose to the occasion as individuals remained confined to their houses, bereft of traditional income and nourishment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Games like My DeFi Pet, for example, allowed players to make money and become more than just pastime. During the epidemic, most active P2E gamers were from Southeast Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gamers were motivated to improve their abilities because they may earn US Dollars. Positive response encouraged the region&#8217;s kids, who earned $1,200 monthly from just one game. Because remittance accounts were inaccessible during the outbreak, many families relied on GameFi for revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, companies like Yield Guild Games (YGG) boosted GameFi&#8217;s possibilities. P2E gaming requires in-game NFTs, which some individuals cannot pay. By giving community support and scholarships, YYG overcomes this barrier. Renting metaverse assets adds another layer to their economics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tech-savvy but unbanked?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ASEAN young are particularly tech-savvy, which drives GameFi adoption. Over 90% of the 213 million young people in the region now have mobile internet. However, approximately 290 million people in Southeast Asia remain unbanked, meaning just 18% of the population has access to traditional financial services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GameFi helps individuals in limbo, while blockchain-based solutions provide access to digital wallets and cross-border payments. The company has also made financial services more inclusive than before, contributing to GameFi&#8217;s entire value offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GameFi also provides liquidity to in-game assets, enabling off-chain transactions. Gamers may use their gaming assets offline in a variety of ways. Players can fractionalize assets and use them in DeFi protocols.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others may pledge them as loan collateral or trade them in secondary markets and derivatives markets. GameFi, in a sense, unlocks the hitherto untapped potential of in-game assets, which was previously unreachable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Vietnam&#8217;s pivotal role in GameFi&#8217;s progress must be emphasized. GameFi&#8217;s most popular product, Axie Infinity, is Vietnamese. As well as superior to typical blockchains in terms of quick block confirmation, low transaction fees and over ten thousand transactions per second.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sign up to our Newsletter below to get insight from industry leaders and forecasts</h3>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://metaversenewscom.substack.com/embed\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\" style=\"border:1px solid #EEE; background:white;\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow Metaverse News anywhere we publish,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Metaversenewsgo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/metaversenewsworld/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a></p><p>The post <a href=\"https://metaversenews.com/the-potential-of-gamefi/\">The Potential of GameFi</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://metaversenews.com\">Metaverse News</a>.</p>",

CARV has unveiled the CARV1 Metaboard, a digital collectable hoverboard.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each Metaboard uses avatar integration based on the metaverse platform and includes bespoke avatar movements and improvements. The hoverboard&#8217;s physics system lets you execute stunts and optimizes items per metaverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nathan Grotticelli, CEO of CARV, said individuals use Metaboards to travel 3D model terrains in ever-growing virtual worlds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With hovering, you can surf ocean waves, snowy slopes, and concrete skateparks. Grotticelli adds, &#8220;We&#8217;re pushing out sample examples, including 3D scans of real-world riding spots.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The inaugural CARV1 collection will include 50 super-rad designs with varying rarity and speed. 500 limited edition 3D elements are included. The business now limits sales to two per consumer, but hopes to increase that later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Ready Player Me avatar may utilize Metaboards in any supported world. CARV has agreements with 15 additional apps/companies to integrate soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtual hoverboards aren&#8217;t a fad. LEVRTV lets you ride your board in the showroom. The CARV team encourages signing up on their website to obtain a direct link delivered to your email if you&#8217;re interested in checking out the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grotticelli sees avatars using Metaboards to watch live-action 360 and volumetric video with better vertical control and less dizziness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Owners may market boards to other collectors, ride over 3D terrain (including NeRFs), and engage in the Hoverball eSport championship. A tweet teases AR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We enable freestyle stunts and Hoverball, a VR-first esport. Our teammate&#8217;s past experience selling hoverboards in Secondlife 10 years ago inspired this. People liked cruising and jumping, but their Rocket-league/Quidditch-esq Simball gaming was popular, says Grotticelli.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CARV intends a skate/street artist drop for their Metaboards.

It intends to accomplish this goal through decentralizing the Internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"883\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/web.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3230\" srcset=\"https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/web.jpeg 883w, https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/web-300x147.jpeg 300w, https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/web-770x378.jpeg 770w, https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/web-500x245.jpeg 500w, https://metaversenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/web-293x144.jpeg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mat Dryhurst, a Berlin-based artist and proponent of the Web3 revolution, explains, &#8220;There is a tiny group of firms who own all this technology, and then there are those of us who utilize it, and despite the fact that we contribute to the success of these platforms, we get nothing in return.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, how would Web3 empower users to take control of the Internet? With the emergence of cryptocurrencies, we&#8217;re already witnessing a peek of how Web3 will operate. Bitcoin, for example, does not belong to anybody, and the data on the Bitcoin network is not centralized; it is distributed throughout the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Web3 in the rest of 2022</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br></strong>While the notion of Web3 is not completely established, platforms embodying the concept currently exist and are providing opportunities for cooperation and revenue for individuals. Decentralised autonomous organizations (DAO), DeFi platforms, crypto gaming platforms, and even the metaverse are all examples of such platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, because these platforms are so new and intricate, there are financial and educational obstacles to entry. Thus, the first step in becoming acquainted with Web3 will be to acquire knowledge, such as how to navigate the world of non-fungible tokens.<br>While Web3 is a relatively new idea, there is plenty of information about it on the Internet, and a fast Google search may reveal a wealth of information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, when it comes to generating money using Web3, a fast Internet search may not suffice. Gaming, on the other hand, appears to be the least hazardous method to benefit from the new Internet iteration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through their scholarship program, platforms like as the Metaverse Magna have made it simple for Africans to earn from crypto gaming. It enables gamers to participate on cryptocurrency gaming sites such as Axie Infinity, where they may earn up to $2,000 each month. Additionally, a job in Web3 is another way to earn from it in 2022. Experts in web3 and blockchain are in great demand, given the industry is still in its infancy. Dapp University is an excellent resource for learning about professions in Web3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Web3 may appear to be the gleaming new future of the Internet, only time will tell whether it lives up to its numerous promises.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://metaversenews.com/web3-will-be-the-next-stage-of-the-internets-growth/\">Web3 will be the next stage of the Internet‚Äôs growth</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://metaversenews.com\">Metaverse News</a>.</p>",
