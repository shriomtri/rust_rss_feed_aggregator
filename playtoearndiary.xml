<h2><strong>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTS): An overview</strong></h2>
<figure id="attachment_17084" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17084" style="width: 788px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-17084 size-large" title="NFT Header scaled 1" src="https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NFT-Header-scaled-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="NFT Header scaled 1" width="788" height="443" srcset="https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NFT-Header-scaled-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NFT-Header-scaled-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NFT-Header-scaled-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NFT-Header-scaled-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NFT-Header-scaled-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NFT-Header-scaled-1-150x84.jpg 150w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NFT-Header-scaled-1-450x253.jpg 450w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NFT-Header-scaled-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17084" class="wp-caption-text">What is a non-fungible token?<br />Source:investing.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.binance.com/en/nft/what-is-nft#:~:text=An%20NFT%20is%20a%20type,versions%20of%20real%2Dworld%20assets."> An NFT</a> is a unit of data that can be bought, sold, exchanged, and kept on a particular kind of digital ledger known as a blockchain. The NFT grant licensing rights to utilize specific digital or physical assets, such as pictures, artwork, music, or sports highlights, for a predetermined purpose. <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-are-nfts">NFTs</a> are non-fungible, one of a token kind. You will get something entirely different if you exchange one asset for another. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft#:~:text=A%20NFT%20(non%2Dfungible%20token,asset%20that%20cannot%20be%20replicated.">With NFTs</a>, the crypto model has a little altering because each token is distinct and unreplicable, making it impossible for two non-fungible tokens to be equal.</p>
<p>Because NFT trading is extralegal, it typically results in an informal transfer of ownership over the item that lacks a legal basis for enforcement and frequently provides the right to use it as a status symbol. The owner of the digital asset that an NFT purports to represent does not necessarily have intellectual property rights for the NFT. This proves the blockchain record&#8217;s ownership.</p>
<p>NFT cannot be bought or exchanged for equivalent amounts like cryptocurrencies. These attributes contrast with fungible tokens like bitcoins. Bitcoins are interchangeable and may be used as a medium for business transactions because they are identical. An example of an NFT is <a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/">Bored Ape Yacht</a>. Tens of millions of dollars have gone for ape NFT images, digital assets, and mere worksJ PEGs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, cryptocurrencies can be traded or swapped for one another, just like traditional currency can. One bitcoin, for instance, is always worth the same as another. The same is same for Tether, where one unit is always equivalent to another. Because of their fungibility, cryptocurrencies are a good choice for a safe medium of exchange in the digital economy.</p>

It is good to know that most NFT games use dimensions such as 640px by 860px or 1080 px as their preferred resolution. Since the details and clarity of a game on a device depend solely on the number of pixels available, it becomes necessary to know that the higher the screen resolution, the higher the pixel will be available to give you the best gaming experience. Hence, gamers should go after devices with high screen resolutions. Below are suitable options for screen resolutions that can give you the best gaming experience ever:</p>
<p><strong>For Androids:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Resolution 1440 x 3200 pixels (511 PPI density).</li>
<li>Resolution 1344 x 2772 pixels (456 PPI density).</li>
<li>Resolution 1080 x 2340 pixels (386 PPI density).</li>
<li>Resolution 1440 x 3088 pixels (496 PPI density).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>For Computers:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Resolution 1920 x 1080 — FHD (Full HD) / 1080p</li>
<li>Resolution 2560 x 1440 — QHD (Quad HD) / 2K 1440p</li>
<li>Resolution 3840 x 2160 — UHD (Ultra HD) / 4K 2160p</li>
<li>Resolution 7680 × 4320 — FUHD (Full Ultra HD) / 8K 4320p.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>PHONE PROCESSOR (RAM)</strong></h3>
<p>Another critical feature of a suitable gaming device is the size of the storage processor. Device processors, also known as the chipset, function like the brain in the human system. It is responsible for the coordination of all the processes going on in a computer system. It is the central hub of a device. The processor receives and executes every command while performing billions of calculations in a mili-second. Most phones with low processing memory tend to lag on usage. Appropriate devices for NFT gaming should have a minimum RAM of 8 GB with 1 GB of free disk space to install the game.</p>
<h3><strong>BATTERY CAPACITY AND CHARGING SPEED.</strong></h3>
<p>The rate at which you use your device for gaming is directly proportional to the power that would be drained out. Hence, it becomes an excellent idea to seek after machines with good battery capacity for gaming. It is good to note also that factors like a higher screen resolution and refresh rate contribute to the rate at which a battery gets drained. If you are playing NFT games with your phone, do ensure that your phone has at least a 4,500mAh battery capacity to provide a decent battery life that supports gaming for longer hours.</p>
<h3><strong>HIGHER REFRESH RATE</strong></h3>
<p>A higher refresh rate display would induce and allow all the actions and processes on the screen to appear smoother and less hard to follow. This is possible by redrawing the image more times per mili-second. Most gaming devices have these features inbuilt into them. Refresh rates can be as high as 120Hz or 144Hz, or even higher. For Androids, the following instruments ranked best in 2022 concerning their refreshing rate.</p>
<h3><strong>DEVICE COOLING RATE</strong></h3>
<p>If your phone is going to be running games concurrently, it is bound to get hot, and thus, it will require an excellent cooling system to disallow the heat from affecting the performance of your device&#8217;s processor. Most devices would naturally get hot during the prolonged usage period. So, It becomes essential that a device be embedded with an appropriate cooling system to control the heat and prevent the processor from being damaged. This process is called throttling, and most gamers tend to avoid this because of its adverse impacts on gaming devices.</p>
<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>
<p>Gaming is fun and exciting, but it can also be frustrating. If not carried out on an enabling and supporting device, it will surely be frustrating and might even disinterest the gamers. This gives rise to the quest for the best devices on which NFT games can be played and enjoyed. Before selecting any of your desired devices, one thing to consider is the cost of the device.</p>
<p>Aside from price, screen resolution, device professor, battery capacity and charging speed, higher refresh rate, and device cooling rate must also be considered. <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/Phones-fast-charging-speeds-comparison_id125026"><u>Charging speed</u></a>, higher refresh rate, and device cooling rate must also be regarded. This will enhance your <a href="https://excellencexl.com/how-confidence-affects-performance/"><u>in-game performance,</u></a> including concentration. You won’t have to panic about your phone overheating or shutting down while playing any NFT game.</p>

The art competition aims to further solidify the connection between the two communities.</p>
<h2>How to Participate</h2>
<p>Artists who wish to take part in the contest are required to produce artwork that embodies the theme &#8220;Genkai meets Axie.&#8221; Submissions are open to a wide range of mediums, including traditional painting, modern 3D digital art, and even innovative approaches like TikTok NPC dancing.</p>
<p>To take part in the contest, participants must share their artwork on Twitter using the hashtag #GenkaiAxieArt and mention both the CyberKongz and Axie Infinity accounts. Submissions will be accepted until the deadline on August 11th, followed by a week-long judging period.

<p>The latest season also brings joy to the holders of specific collectible characters, namely Mystic, Origin, MEO, MEO II, Japanese, Christmas, Shiny, and Summer Axies. As part of this new initiative, special gifts have been sent to these players&#8217; in-game mailboxes.</p>
<p>This reward system is an experimental initiative influenced by the successful introduction of <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/axie-infinity-introduces-leveling-system-and-new-experience-points/">Axie Experience Points (AXP),</a> which led to an increase in players wanting to use their preferred Axies in Origins. By implementing these rewards, owning a collectible Axie will hold even more significance and utility, adding an extra layer of special meaning to the experience.</p>
<h2>Other Updates</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async data-type="lazy" data-src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In response to feedback from <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/axie-infinity-community-week-to-unite-lunacians-1/">the community</a> about the expensive minting cost of Runes and Charms, Axie Infinity has taken action by cutting the cost in half for Epic and Mystic Runes and Charms. This reduction means that players can now mint twice the number of Runes and Charms they could before, which has the potential to impact crafting habits and marketplace dynamics within the game.</p>
<p>In the fifth season, Axie Infinity is raising the stakes significantly by offering a substantial total of 112,000 AXS as rewards. These rewards are distributed across various categories, such as Leaderboard Rewards, Fortune Chests, Contests, and Weekly Missions, providing more opportunities for casual players to earn AXS and engage in Axie ownership. The reward distribution consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>85,000 AXS for seasonal Leaderboard Rewards</li>
<li>15,000 AXS for Fortune Chests</li>
<li>7,000 AXS for Contests</li>
<li>5,000 AXS for Weekly Missions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Check Out Season 5</h2>
<p>The debut of numerous new features and rewarding prospects in Season 5 is anticipated to provide players with an exciting and thrilling experience, reshaping the <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/tech-trends-changing-the-gaming-landscape/">gaming landscape</a> within Axie Infinity&#8217;s Rare Era.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/aurory-p2e-game-an-introduction-to-gameplay-and-characters/">Aurory</a>, the well-known gaming franchise, has announced its intention to incorporate Ethereum&#8217;s layer-2 scaling solution, Arbitrum. This strategic step is expected to expand Aurory&#8217;s Non-Fungible Token (NFT) games beyond the limitations of the <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/innovative-solution-by-solana-cuts-expenses-for-on-chain-storage/">Solana blockchain</a>. The primary goal of this initiative is to promote greater user participation by allowing Aurory NFTs and its native AURY token to be used interchangeably across various blockchains.</p>
<h2>Aurory’s Objectives</h2>
<p>Aurory&#8217;s primary goal is not to abandon Solana but rather to extend its reach and make its offerings more accessible to users. To achieve this, they are introducing the SyncSpace technology, which will enable users to seamlessly move their assets between Solana and <a href="https://arbitrum.io/">Arbitrum</a>, and even within the games themselves.</p>
<p>Jonathan Campeau, the Executive Producer at Aurory, emphasized that the platform&#8217;s intentions are driven by a desire to diversify, not just from a business standpoint, but also to enhance the user experience. This move is particularly beneficial for those who are more familiar with the <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/ethereum-interoperability-portal-collaboration-gala-games-joins-forces-with-upland/">Ethereum ecosystem</a> and <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/which-crypto-wallet-is-best-for-p2e-gaming/">wallets like MetaMask</a>, simplifying their interactions with the Aurory platform.</p>
<p>Aurory&#8217;s strategy does not involve shifting token holders from one blockchain to another, clarified by Michael Natoli, the Head of Marketing and Business Development. Instead, the objective is to establish fresh entry points into the game and attract participation from various cryptocurrency communities, leveraging their liquidity. This move is intended to expand the Aurory experience into Arbitrum&#8217;s specialized <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/web-3-games-the-biggest-drivers/">Web3 ecosystem.</a></p>
<p>The proposed &#8220;on-ramps&#8221; will allow players to bring their Aurory NFTs and USDC stablecoins into the game using either blockchain. Once inside, USDC can be exchanged for the game&#8217;s native AURY token.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re excited to see <a href="https://twitter.com/AuroryProject?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AuroryProject</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Arbitrum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Arbitrum</a>!</p>

<p><script async data-type="lazy" data-src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>Aurory&#8217;s expansion is laying the groundwork for future growth. While they are currently focusing on integrating with Arbitrum, it is just the initial phase. Aurory has their eyes set on other chains like <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/top-5-p2e-polygon-games/">Polygon</a> and <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/the-top-three-avalanche-p2e-games/">Avalanche</a> as well. By venturing into Arbitrum, Aurory aims to introduce exciting new game experiences that are tailored to specific chains, encouraging players to venture into different blockchain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Aurory is actively working on developing two games: &#8220;Aurory Adventures,&#8221; a role-playing game focused on player-versus-environment interactions, and &#8220;Aurory Tactics,&#8221; a battle arena game centered around player-versus-player battles.</p>
<p>This strategic decision is anticipated to strengthen Aurory&#8217;s position within the NFT gaming industry and advance its ambition to lead the way in providing innovative <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/aurory-unveils-cross-platform-expansion/">cross-chain gaming</a> experiences.</p>
<h2>More on Aurory</h2>
<p>Aurory is a cutting-edge entertainment franchise that revolves around groundbreaking gaming experiences and captivating narrative content that extends to various media such as comics, animation, film, TV, social engagement, and consumer products.</p>
<p>The company boasts a skilled team comprising individuals with backgrounds in both gaming and cryptocurrency industries, including former employees from renowned companies like Ubisoft and Electronic Arts. Leveraging this expertise, Aurory offers engaging gaming experiences and ownership benefits across multiple platforms, effectively blurring the lines between virtual worlds and reality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new multiplayer game called Spider Tanks, which operates on <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/solana-labs-introduces-gameshift-api-to-empower-web3-game-development/">Web3 technology</a> has recently launched its Spider Friends Referral Program. This program aims to reward players who bring new enthusiasts to join the thrilling battlefield.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spidertanks.game/">Spider Tanks</a> players are known for their strong sense of camaraderie. While the battlefield is a place of fierce competition, it also fosters an environment for sharing game strategies and forming new friendships. Despite the game&#8217;s already growing popularity, the Spider Tanks team believes in the motto &#8220;the more, the merrier!&#8221; They are excited to welcome and challenge newcomers who are ready to prove their skills and climb the ranks in the game.</p>
<h2>The Referral Program</h2>
<p>In order to promote player expansion, Spider Tanks has implemented the Spider Friends Referral Program. This innovative initiative enables existing players to receive complimentary Tank Parts by inviting their friends to join the game. Each referred friend who achieves ten wins contributes to the player&#8217;s advancement in <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/global-cup-22-sorare-announces/">earning additional rewards.</a></p>
<p>Players who are interested can locate the referral link under &#8216;Refer A Friend&#8217; in the top navigation bar on games.gala.com. This link directs new players to the game, and as soon as these new players achieve their first ten wins, the referring player makes progress toward the next bonus.</p>
<p>The rewards include:</p>
<ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile gaming has witnessed notable transformations due to the emergence of <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/nfts-banned-in-gta-online-by-rockstar-games/">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a> and their integration into gaming. Google Play and the Apple App Store, two significant players in the mobile app market, have adopted distinct strategies regarding NFTs and <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/fun-over-money-what-crypto/">crypto gaming.</a> This article will look at the policies of these platforms, the impact on game developers, and the ever-changing landscape of NFTs in the world of mobile gaming.</p>
<h2><strong>Google Play Updates</strong></h2>
<p>In a recent blog post, Google Play made an announcement regarding its revised policy, granting video game publishers the ability to offer NFT games for sale on their platform. According to Google, this policy update includes a requirement for apps to be upfront with users about <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/how-to-create-assets-for-decentraland/">tokenized digital assets</a>. This move demonstrates Google&#8217;s openness to exploring novel methods of facilitating transactions involving blockchain-based digital content within apps and games.</p>
<p>Developers are obligated to disclose the inclusion of NFTs in their games and maintain clear and open communication with users about tokenized assets, as mandated by Google&#8217;s policy. The policy explicitly prohibits promoting potential earnings from gaming or merchandising activities and also restricts the sale of loot boxes or <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/sorare-adapts-gaming-offer-to-french-gambling-rules/">gambling mechanics</a> within the games.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-22340" title="Google Play" src="https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-300x169.jpg" alt="Google Play" width="831" height="468" srcset="https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-300x169.jpg 300w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-768x432.jpg 768w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-150x84.jpg 150w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-450x253.jpg 450w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Google-Play.jpg 1706w" sizes="(max-width: 831px) 100vw, 831px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Blockchain Gaming on Andro</strong><strong>id</strong></h2>
<p>Google Play&#8217;s embrace of NFTs and blockchain games represents a notable chance for <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/investors-continue-to-show-a-preference-for-web3-gaming-developers/">game developers</a> using the Android platform. The acceptance of tokenized assets aims to enrich user experiences and encourages the transformation of conventional games through user-owned content.</p>
<p>Google Play&#8217;s goal is to cultivate user loyalty by fostering an environment that supports these innovations. Their collaboration with <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/immutable-and-polygon-labs-join-forces-to-revolutionize-web3-gaming/">Web3 gaming</a> pioneers and their efforts to comprehend developers&#8217; obstacles and possibilities underscore Google&#8217;s dedication to the dynamic realm of blockchain gaming.</p>
<p>According to one of Google&#8217;s regulations, NFTs purchased by users should be utilized within the game to enhance their experience or assist them in progressing further. The usage of NFTs for gambling or <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/p2e-hit-calvaria-introduces-staking/">staking,</a> in exchange for the chance to win real-world monetary prizes (including other NFTs) is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Google is pursuing a careful strategy by teaming up with specific game developers to experiment with and enhance the user experience of <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/the-global-blockchain-gaming-market-is-projected-to-grow-1/">blockchain games</a>. By forming partnerships with notable industry participants such as <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191120005481/en/Mythical-Games-Raises-Additional-19-Million-Bringing-Total-Funding-to-35-Million-as-Studio-Expands-Development-of-Tech-Platform-First-Game-for-Launch">Mythical Games</a> and Reddit, Google displays its dedication to establishing a fair environment that fosters user confidence and responsible utilization of blockchain technology. Through an iterative development process, Google aims to shape policies that cater to the evolving requirements of developers and the mobile gaming community.</p>
<h2><strong>Apple is More Restrictive</strong></h2>
<p>Unlike Google Play, the Apple App Store has historically adopted a more stringent stance towards NFTs and crypto gaming. Although developers are permitted to integrate NFTs into iOS games and apps, Apple continues to enforce its standard 30% commission on transactions involving NFTs. This commission system presents difficulties for developers, as they must adjust NFT prices to account for Apple&#8217;s fees, which could potentially result in higher costs for users.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The contrasting approaches of Google Play and the Apple App Store mirror a broader split within the mobile gaming industry concerning NFTs and crypto integration. Google Play is open to the possibilities of NFTs and blockchain gaming, whereas Apple takes a more cautious approach, prioritizing the retention of its commission structure and responsible implementation. As a result of this divide, developers and users will encounter distinct experiences when operating on the two platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Currently, gaming revolves around crafting captivating virtual environments for players to indulge in, aligning perfectly with the metaverse concept. Additionally, gamers can generate tangible worth from their digital creations and <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/nfts-banned-in-gta-online-by-rockstar-games/">non-fungible tokens (NFTs). </a></p>
<p>However, what other advancements can we anticipate in the gaming realm in the future? Let&#8217;s explore the transformative influence of the metaverse, web3 technology, and innovative revenue models reshaping the essence of the gaming experience.</p>
<h2>The Metaverse</h2>
<p>The gaming industry has consistently embraced technological advancements, and the metaverse represents the latest frontier in this progression. As games continue to advance and offer increasingly immersive experiences, they are set to play a central role within the expansive metaverse ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/tmt/what-s-possible-for-the-gaming-industry-in-the-next-dimension/chapter-3-insights-on-the-metaverse-and-the-future-of-gaming">As per a survey</a> conducted by Ernst and Young, an overwhelming 97% of executives in the gaming industry affirm that gaming currently holds a central position within the metaverse. In theory, any <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/web3-is-augmented-and-virtual-reality-our-future/">virtual reality (VR)</a> game has the potential to be integrated into the metaverse. However, it is important to note that the fundamental essence of <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/momoverse-a-metaverse-of-exciting-play-to-earn-games/">the metaverse</a> lies in interconnectedness.</p>
<p>Players must be able to effortlessly navigate between different games and experiences, carrying their digital identities, assets, and accomplishments with them. In order to achieve such a high level of compatibility, game developers will need to collaborate in the creation of shared universes and cross-platform experiences.</p>
<p>Back in 2020, Tim Sweeney, the CEO of <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/gods-unchained-now-available-on-the-epic-games-store/">Epic Games</a>, the company behind the <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/nike-and-fortnite-generate-buzz-with-potential-nft-collaboration/">Fortnite gaming universe</a>, shared his vision of gaming within the metaverse. He envisioned a shift away from isolated ecosystems towards a more open environment, gradually resembling an inclusive metaverse by the end of the current decade.</p>
<p>In this envisioned metaverse, players would gather with their friends and seamlessly transition between different game experiences while staying connected as a group, irrespective of the platforms they are using. This would eliminate concerns about the device manufacturer or the server operator, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in these collective experiences.</p>
<figure id="attachment_19400" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19400" style="width: 774px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-19400" title="" src="https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1-300x169.png" alt="" width="774" height="436" srcset="https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1-300x169.png 300w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1-1024x577.png 1024w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1-768x433.png 768w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1-150x85.png 150w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1-450x254.png 450w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1-1200x676.png 1200w, https://playtoearndiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Forkast-Opinion-Images-11-1260x710-1.png 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-19400" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: The Coin Republic.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Decentralizing Gaming Using Web3</h2>
<p>Web3 technology, which harnesses the potential of blockchain and decentralized protocols, is on the brink of transforming the gaming industry by granting players genuine digital ownership and authority over their <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/the-mmo-nft-game-farsite-create-your-own-in-game-assets/">in-game assets</a>. Although the ability to purchase in-game assets already exists in numerous games, these items are typically associated with specific games rather than individual players or avatars.</p>
<p>However, in the future internet, gamers will have the ability to engage in trading, selling, or transferring their digital items as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) across diverse platforms, facilitated by web3 technologies. This advancement will not only facilitate a seamless experience for players but also introduce novel revenue streams and bolster the growth of a thriving digital economy.</p>
<h2>P2E Models Monetizing Gameplay</h2>
<p>With the increasing adoption of <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/how-to-be-safe-in-web-3-0/">web3 technology,</a> play-to-earn (P2E) models is emerging as a trend, granting players the ability to generate income from their in-game endeavors and accomplishments. P2E games offer rewards to players for tasks completion, battling other players, or progressing through various levels.</p>
<p>These rewards typically come in the form of in-game tokens or assets represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can be traded, sold, or exchanged for real-world value. This innovative approach is disrupting traditional gaming business models, enhancing the rewards of gameplay, and incentivizing active player engagement.</p>
<p>P2E models have the potential to democratize gaming by providing earning opportunities for players, particularly in regions where access to conventional financial systems is limited. An example of a prominent P2E game utilizing blockchain technology is <a href="https://playtoearndiary.com/exciting-updates-on-axie-infinity/">Axie Infinity.</a></p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>There is no denying the exhilarating prospects that lie ahead for the gaming industry, driven by the transformative forces of the metaverse and web3 technologies. These advancements are set to introduce a fresh era of interconnected and immersive experiences. As the gaming landscape undergoes profound changes, we can anticipate the emergence of a more diverse and inclusive industry that presents vast opportunities for both players and developers alike.</p>
