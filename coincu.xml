<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Web3 gaming company Aurory announces integration with Arbitrum, Ethereum&#8217;s Layer 2 scaling solution, enabling digital asset existence on both Arbitrum and Solana blockchains.</em></li>



<li><em>Players can now use SyncSpace technology to deposit and withdraw gaming assets between Solana and Arbitrum, offering a seamless cross-chain experience.</em></li>



<li><em>This significant milestone advances Aurory&#8217;s multi-platform vision and enhances the utility of in-game assets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aurory, a renowned web3 gaming company offering a universe of interoperable games, has taken a significant step towards its multi-platform vision. The company recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aurory-franchise-enables-cross-chain-operability-with-arbitrum-integration-301885313.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its integration with <a href="https://coincu.com/204281-arbitrum-foundation-grants-phase-1-targets-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbitrum</a>, the leading Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, opening up new possibilities for digital asset acquisition and management within its gaming ecosystem.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-1024x576.png" alt="Aurory Sets The Stage For Seamless Web3 Gaming With New Integration On Arbitrum" class="wp-image-205906" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aurory Sets The Stage For Seamless Web3 Gaming With New Integration On Arbitrum 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>While Aurory&#8217;s free-to-play games don&#8217;t require wallet connections, the company has enabled on-chain Aurory assets to exist on both Arbitrum and Solana, two prominent blockchain ecosystems within the web3 gaming realm. These assets encompass AURY tokens, playable NFT characters, skins, and Neftie eggs, all of which serve or will serve a utility in Aurory&#8217;s flagship games, Adventures (JRPG) and Tactics (Timeline-Based Battle Arena).</p>



<p>SyncSpace technology plays a pivotal role in making this integration possible. It is a proprietary hybrid on-chain/off-chain inventory management system specifically designed by Aurory. Originally aimed at reducing friction for new users entering the Aurory gaming universe without the need for wallet connections, SyncSpace also allows them to earn in-game items that can later be minted on-chain when withdrawn to an external wallet. Moreover, users can deposit on-chain items into SyncSpace, facilitating seamless gameplay, trading, Neftie egg hatching, Aurorian expeditions, and more without the constant need for blockchain transaction approvals.</p>



<p>By leveraging SyncSpace, Aurory now empowers gamers to deposit their assets from the Solana network into SyncSpace and withdraw them on the Arbitrum network and vice versa, ensuring a seamless cross-chain experience. Notably, this innovation also opens the door for Aurory games to integrate with traditional gaming platforms that impose stricter regulations on incorporating blockchain elements.</p>

<p>The integration with Arbitrum comes at a time when the network is making substantial strides in the web3 gaming industry. During the first quarter of 2023, Arbitrum witnessed a staggering 125% growth in active blockchain gaming users, thanks to its cutting-edge technological advancements in scaling performance. The Arbitrum Nova scaling solution utilizes &#8220;AnyTrust&#8221; technology, processing data off-chain to enable low-cost transactions, which is particularly beneficial for game developers handling high transaction volumes.</p>



<p>Arbitrum has been a hotbed of activity lately, attracting prominent projects in the blockchain gaming space. Notably, Xai, a gaming-focused permissionless Layer 3 blockchain, revealed plans to launch on the network later this year. Additionally, The Graph, a leading indexing and query protocol for organizing blockchain data, recently commenced its final phase of migration to Arbitrum. Moreover, Cega expanded its structured DeFi investment product to the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>

<p>As Aurory&#8217;s integration with Arbitrum unfolds, players can now choose to have their gaming assets reside on the network, including Aury tokens, playable NFT characters, skins, and Neftie eggs. These assets hold significant value within Aurory&#8217;s flagship games, Adventures, and Tactics, enhancing the gaming experience for users.</p>



<p>The collaboration between Aurory and Arbitrum marks a notable milestone in the web3 gaming industry, propelling cross-chain gaming capabilities to new heights. With these advancements, players can expect an enhanced and seamless gaming experience while further solidifying Ethereum&#8217;s position as a leading blockchain platform for gaming innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Find Satoshi Lab introduces Gas Hero, a Web3 MMO game set in a post-apocalyptic world.</em></li>



<li><em>&#8220;Shape the Legends, Share the Glory&#8221; competition launched, allowing community members to design Genesis Heroes NFTs and win creator royalties and GMT tokens.</em></li>



<li><em>Gas Hero emphasizes social interaction, refined user experience, and player involvement before the game&#8217;s release, signaling a shift in Web3 gaming.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Web3 development studio Find Satoshi Lab (FSL), renowned for creating popular projects like StepN, MOOAR NFT marketplace, and DOOAR decentralized trading platform, has <a href="https://twitter.com/GasHeroOfficial/status/1678403803375083521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> its latest creation: Gas Hero, a highly anticipated massively multiplayer online (MMO) game.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-611.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-611.png" alt="StepN Creator Unveils Gas Hero, A New Web3 MMO Game" class="wp-image-201530" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-611.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-611-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-611-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-611-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="StepN Creator Unveils Gas Hero, A New Web3 MMO Game 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>To mark the game&#8217;s upcoming release, <a href="https://coincu.com/191213-find-satoshi-lab-to-launch-ai-nft-generator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FSL</a> has launched the &#8220;Shape the Legends, Share the Glory&#8221; competition, inviting community members to design their own versions of the game&#8217;s NFTs, known as Genesis Heroes. The competition offers participants a chance to win two percent creator royalty fees and a portion of the game&#8217;s utility token, GMT.</p>



<p>In each phase of the competition, 20 winners will be selected for each codename, resulting in a total of 320 winners per phase and 960 winners overall. Prizes include Genesis Hero NFT trading royalties, GMT tokens, and a co-branded Gas Hero and FSL t-shirt. The winning designs will also be prominently featured on the official Gas Hero website.</p>



<p>This competition marks a significant shift in Web3 gaming, emphasizing the active involvement of players even before the game&#8217;s official launch.</p>



<p>While details about Gas Hero are still largely under wraps, the game&#8217;s name does not refer to the crypto industry term &#8220;gas,&#8221; which typically denotes network transaction fees. Instead, Gas Hero is set to be a strategic and socially-oriented Web3 game, immersing players in a post-apocalyptic world where they construct virtual bases and engage in battles against other players.</p>

<p>Mitali Manghani, a representative from FSL, highlighted the social aspects of the game, noting that players will be incentivized to interact with one another to gain advantages such as power, fame, and monetary rewards. FSL places great importance on refining the game&#8217;s user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) to ensure engaging and immersive gameplay.</p>



<p>Gas Hero follows the success of FSL&#8217;s previous gaming venture, <a href="https://coincu.com/181437-binance-futures-delisting-stepn-near/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StepN</a>, which recently made waves as the first blockchain gaming app to integrate <a href="https://coincu.com/189045-stepn-incorporates-apple-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Pay</a>.</p>



<p>The competition spans three phases over three months, running from July 10 to October 9. The initial phase, concluding on August 8, challenges participants to submit designs for a pre-selected list of character codenames, including Ape Commander, Ascetic Monk, Combat Queen, Lone Werewolf, and more.</p>

<p>Gas Hero&#8217;s lore revolves around a dystopian future set in the year 2084, where a rogue AI triggers a nuclear strike. In response, the United Nations establishes Operation Spark, leading to the creation of the &#8220;Gas Heroes.&#8221; In the game&#8217;s science-fiction world, &#8220;gas&#8221; refers to the natural gas powering the cloning labs.</p>



<p>While Gas Hero is currently in development, the game will utilize StepN&#8217;s GMT token upon launch and will offer its own marketplace. Additionally, Gas Hero will incorporate player voting mechanisms for decentralized decision-making within the game.</p>



<p>As the Gas Hero community eagerly awaits the game&#8217;s release, the Shape the Legends, Share the Glory competition stands as a testament to FSL&#8217;s commitment to community engagement and the evolving landscape of Web3 gaming.</p>

<p>Illuvitars are unique and dynamic collectable works of art that reflect a particular avatar of an Illuvial with a distinct expression. Each Illuvitar has a power rating based on its rarity, which helps you climb the scoreboard.</p>



<p>Each GameStop x Illuvitar D1SK comes with a one-of-a-kind GameStop-branded Illuvitar with over 108 possible combinations based on six distinct Illuvials, three emotions, three backdrop stages, and two finishes.</p>



<p>All GameStop D1SK buyers will get early access to both the creature collection game, Illuvium Overworld, and the strategic auto-battler, Illuvium Arena!</p>



<p>Illuvium is a blockchain-based game developed on Ethereum that makes use of the Immutable X network and its Layer-2 scaling mechanism. The role-playing game (RPG) features the creation of 3D cutting-edge characters with real-time character-focused gameplay, all while allowing players to earn in-game non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and stake their tokenized assets in a decentralized, zero-fee framework. </p>



<p>Illuvium also uses a privacy-preserving, highly scalable architecture with Zero-Knowledge Rollups (zk-Rollups). To complement these and other features, the game employs a decentralized governance structure designed to profit from the ecosystem&#8217;s ILV token and the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).</p>



<p>GameStop, long renowned as a brick-and-mortar game store, moved to crypto a year after the historic r/wallstreetbets short squeeze drove its stock surging in January 2021. GameStop created an NFT and cryptocurrency subsidiary in January 2022.</p>

<p>COMBO is a scaling solution provider for Web3 game development. It is creating an open-source, decentralized, game-oriented Layer-2 that is available to everyone by using the world&#8217;s top gaming engine.</p>



<p>The fundamental goal of the network is to maximize the potential of Web3 gaming by providing game developers with a platform that is readily accessible, fairly priced, effective, and secure. COMBO plans to address the scalability challenges that developers have in the Web3 gaming industry by implementing a game-oriented Layer-2 approach that will enable them to create vast and engaging gaming experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Telos Foundation has partnered with GameStop to promote Web3-based gaming.</em></li>



<li><em>The agreement allows the Telos blockchain to have access to game distribution through GameStop Playr, the company&#8217;s upcoming Web3 game launcher.</em></li>



<li><em>GameStop created a gaming-focused NFT marketplace and a cryptocurrency wallet last year.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>With a collaboration with the Telos Foundation, GameStop is enhancing its NFT gaming approach. The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/telos-announces-strategic-collaboration-with-gamestop-to-expand-web3-gaming-301839456.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnership</a> between GameStop and Telos seeks to bring gaming on the Telos blockchain using GameStop&#8217;s Web3 game launcher, known as GameStop Playr.</strong></h5>

<p>The agreement, according to the press release, may help drive up to 100 million gamers to web3 over the next two years.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Telos has collaborated with <a href="https://twitter.com/GameStopNFT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@GameStopNFT</a> to introduce GameStop Playr, a new Web3 game launcher bringing mainstream gaming to Web3! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3ae.png" alt="🎮" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>Power to the Web3 Players.<br><br>Official Announcement <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png" alt="🔗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/atdBeatqOc" target="_blank">https://t.co/atdBeatqOc</a> <a href="https://t.co/iJcCM6h7Aq" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/iJcCM6h7Aq</a></p>&mdash; The Telos Foundation (@HelloTelos) <a href="https://twitter.com/HelloTelos/status/1664274325489459200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 1, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to AJ Dinger, director of business development at the Telos Foundation, the cooperation will assist in onboarding new players to the Web3 gaming environment by using Telos&#8217; powerful network.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We believe this collaboration will be a meaningful driver of new users into the Web3 space. By combining GameStop Playr with Web3 games utilizing Telos&#8217; high-performance blockchain infrastructure, we can break down many of the barriers currently deterring Web2 players from embracing Web3,&#8221; said Dinger.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The alliance intends to link the traditional gaming community with the Web3 audience while also inspiring traditional game studios, publishers, and distributors to experiment with Web3 technologies.</p>



<p>For well over a year, GameStop has been working on extending to web3 in order to capitalize on the &#8220;meme stock&#8221; frenzy and resuscitate its company. The efforts seem to have paid off, as the company reported its first quarterly profit in two years in March 2023.</p>

<p>GameStop is one of the biggest legacy gaming companies that has opted to accept blockchain technology and use it to advance its company. Last year, the store even opened its own NFT marketplace, which received almost $5 million in its first week. It announced cooperation with layer 1 blockchain Immutable X in February 2022 to create a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace for exchanging in-game assets.</p>



<p>The marketplace, which has been in public beta since July, will be open to the public in October 2022. In May 2022, the shop will also unveil its self-custodial crypto and NFT wallet.</p>



<p>Other gaming organizations are now turning to blockchain technology to help them grow their businesses. Square Enix is undoubtedly the industry&#8217;s most venerable brand, having consistently reiterated its commitment to a web3 future.</p>

<p>It was on May 31 that the co-founder of the RPG series Illuvium, Kieran Warwick, released a statement in the Discord community that he had raised an additional $10 million in funding from Framework Ventures.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="645" height="331" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689.png" alt="Massive Blockchain Game Illuvium Raises Another $10M From Framework Ventures" class="wp-image-191102" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689.png 645w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" title="Massive Blockchain Game Illuvium Raises Another $10M From Framework Ventures 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The money raised will accelerate the development of this game. This transaction is completed through a token, which will be locked for two years and will not be included in the commit, so it will not participate in the distribution of benefits.</p>



<p>Reportedly, Illuvium is an entirely decentralized collectible and role-playing game built on the Immutable X L2 network. Illuvium is about to launch a public beta with three interactive AAA games: Zero (city builder), Overworld (monster world), and Arena (arena).</p>



<p>Founded last year by Kieran and Aaron Warwick, this RPG has created a game that rewards players with the chance to discover and capture NFT creatures, known as Illuvials, in combat. The game incentivizes players to have a stake in the project, as the Illuvium network allows in-game fees to be paid out to staked token holders as ongoing rewards.</p>

<p>In March 2021, Illuvium successfully raised $5 million in a seed round led by one of the oldest venture capital funds in the decentralized finance, Framework Ventures. The project has also received financial support from IOSG Ventures, LD Capital, Delphi Digital, YBB Foundation Ltd, Stake Capital, Moonwhale Ventures, Lotus Capital, Blocksync Ventures, Bitscale Capital, Quantstamp, Yield Guild Games, Bitcoin.com, …</p>



<p>In mid-April 2022, Framework Ventures, a backer of Illuvium and Stardust, said it would invest $200 million in blockchain game projects following the launch of a $400 million fund.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>GTA 6, the next edition, is set to make a quantum leap in game design and player benefits by embracing the crypto revolution.</em></li>



<li><em>While the intricacies of GTA 6&#8217;s gameplay mechanics and microtransactions are undisclosed, experts assume the game will use blockchain technology.</em></li>



<li><em>The new game may give players additional motivation to participate by allowing them to earn and sell in-game crypto prizes.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reports that the highly anticipated game <a href="https://news.coincu.com/102699-grand-theft-auto-6-introduce-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> (GTA 6) would be a blockchain game or incorporate some form of coin that can be redeemed in real life returned this week after first surfacing in 2021 and then circling again last year has resurfaced.</strong></h5>

<p>The assertions, however, are now unverified. A cryptocurrency Twitter account was listed as the source of the claims in a <em><a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/crypto-made-easy/gta-6-could-introduce-a-crypto-reward-system/77777/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes India</a></em> story, and neither Rockstar Games nor parent company Take-Two Interactive has verified or rejected the reports so far.</p>

<p>GTA 6, the next edition, is set to make a quantum leap in game design and player benefits by embracing the crypto revolution. As the anticipation grows, let&#8217;s go deep into this exciting development in our favorite open-world action adventure.</p>



<p>Several stories have referenced a recent popular <a href="https://twitter.com/MatDefies/status/1661820136469176339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a> from a gaming content provider as their source for the information, although this tweet lacks proof supporting the allegations and is purely supposition.</p>



<p>While the intricacies of GTA 6&#8217;s gameplay mechanics and microtransactions are undisclosed, experts assume the game will use blockchain technology. This strategy might result in players converting earnings earned during games into real-world currency. According to observers, the reported GTA 6 play-to-earn strategy would feature crypto incentives, which will alter how gamers play and earn.</p>

<p>The new Rockstar Games adventure feature has the potential to turn conventional gaming into an additional source of revenue. According to GTA 6 leaks, the game franchise&#8217;s sixteenth overall chapter will include Bitcoin (BTC) as a payment option and incentive token.</p>



<p>While Rockstar Software has not commented on the reported in-game cryptocurrency incentive system, the company has previously confirmed GTA 6&#8217;s development, saying:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“With the unprecedented longevity of GTA 5, we know many of you have been asking us about a new entry in the Grand Theft Auto series. With every new project we embark on, our goal is always to markedly move beyond what we have previously delivered – and we are pleased to confirm that active development for the Grand Theft Auto series’ next entry is well underway.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Although Take-Two has made crypto steps, like having its Zynga studio work on Web3 games, Rockstar banned NFTs and bitcoin on fan-operated Grand Theft Auto V servers in November.</p>



<p>The play-to-earn trend has caused quite a stir in the gaming business, transforming what was previously a pastime into a possible money source. In keeping with this developing trend, GTA 6 may include Bitcoin, one of the world&#8217;s biggest crypto assets, as an in-game payment option and reward token. As a result, a progressive game like GTA 6 might provide more complex play-to-earn transactional services using cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Axie Avatar Forge includes features that allow users to diversify their profile.</p>



<p>To begin, users may choose from a palette of 20 backdrop colors, including translucent, for their PNG or GIF. This enables matching their axie to a personal or business identity in either the digital or physical domains simpler than before. They can also zoom out to display your axie&#8217;s whole body or zoom in on its face. They now have more influence over their digital identity than ever before, thanks to Avatar Forge.</p>



<p>Users may use elements from the Axie Avatar Forge to build full animated scenarios, or they can freeze the frame of an axie in the midst of an action, such as halfway through a backflip.</p>



<p>While creating their avatar, users may additionally turn axie accessories on or off using the Axie Avatar Forge.</p>



<p>In addition, the team will commemorate the debut of the Axie Avatar Forge with a community challenge. Respond to the announcement tweet with an avatar from the Axie Avatar Maker. The best five responses in terms of overall likes will each get one Japanese axie. The competition will be open until June 7.</p>



<p>Sky Mavis has announced that Axie Infinity: Origins is now accessible on the Apple App Store, although for a limited number of countries, as Coincu previously <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188114-axie-infinity-launched-on-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>. Sky Games&#8217; long-term goal is to capitalize on the popularity of Axie Infinity Classic in 2021 by delivering a better gaming experience that does not need users to acquire NFTs and is available via conventional app stores.</p>



<p>Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam are among the countries involved in the launch, with a concentration on Latin America and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
